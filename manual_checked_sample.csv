"It has long been recognised (and one of the key reasons why countries like South Korea, Germany & Japan have been so successful) that long-term fixing and ring-fencing of an optimum allocation of education budget per pupil for schools (similar to what Gordon Brown invested in when he has PM before Cameron slashed it as part of austerity measures) improves the lives and wellbeing of not only children, but the long-term prospects of the country as a whole, including economic growth, entrepreneurship, innovation, employment, business success, etc.
Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, mental health, physical health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.
Having an agile and fully-funded world class education system (with healthy school meals for all) is a cornerstone to a nation's long-term success !",Positive

I love maths it is a easy subject if you understand formulas so you can solve hardest sums.,Positive
"Rishi Sunak promotes a broken system. You can't force people to be good or even do anything, if they don't see why or feel unable to do it. 
The question to be asked here is: why do we have to force people to do it? Why don't they want to do it? How can we motivate them? Is the system failing the students and if so, why? 
It's always the same old story: if it doesn't work, add pressure to the people. 
That won't do any good, but at least you can tell yourself, you've done something. 
By the way, I didn't know that Mr.Sunak is an expert in education. Has he hidden talents as a mathematican or a math-teacher?馃槀",Negative

"If I were Rishi Sunk I would strengthen maths lower down the years (i.e year 5-8). People who are good at maths are usually (not always) only ever good at maths because their parents drilled it into them or they got tutored at a young age.

"A Level & Scottish Highers are at a level equivalent to US undergraduate first & second year maths.
