Dhnxer0lClw,Ugy9ha3sZkH4jqDhyYp4AaABAg,"It has long been recognised (and one of the key reasons why countries like South Korea, Germany & Japan have been so successful) that long-term fixing and ring-fencing of an optimum allocation of education budget per pupil for schools (similar to what Gordon Brown invested in when he has PM before Cameron slashed it as part of austerity measures) improves the lives and wellbeing of not only children, but the long-term prospects of the country as a whole, including economic growth, entrepreneurship, innovation, employment, business success, etc.
Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, mental health, physical health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.

The question to be asked here is: why do we have to force people to do it? Why don't they want to do it? How can we motivate them? Is the system failing the students and if so, why? 
It's always the same old story: if it doesn't work, add pressure to the people.

Children at 16 who can't understand probability and statistics will struggle to make informed decisions.

While mathematical logic can't be applied to real life all the time, maths will also help with rational thinking.

Forcing all kids to do the A level maths curriculum as is won't help though. I'm sorry but no one needs to know how to differentiate and integrate functions.

Unless there is a plan for a ""maths for everyday life"" alternative which would focus on statistics, financial literacy and logical reasoning among other things, than this plan won't work.",@aminmohamed520,2023-04-17T23:27:49Z,8

Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, mental health, physical health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.

Vast numbers of Accountants and Quantity Surveyors rely on good numeracy, not abstract concepts.

Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, poor health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.

DH50qcVaDzg,UgznBABdMFHnD90ORYt4AaABAg,"A question: Is the story breaking in today's Guardian about Tory failure to back the schools catch-up plan developed by Sir Kevan Collins being directly responsible for the North-South disparities in exam results, not a case of underfunding that should forewarn Starmer that a policy agenda based primarily on affordability criteria - and that follows current Treasury orthodoxy - should not be allowed to overtake strategic importance if further harm is to be avoided?  

If there are strategic investment priorities that are critical to making progress on the deeply undermined public infrastructure and services, then is it not unavoidable that some there must be some spending priorities that cannot be sacrificed?  Is there a political case for long term borrowing, if the alternative is more of this sort of failure down the road?  Or is Starmer merely waiting for the Tory crash pile-ups to make his argument for him?

I refer to this breaking story in the Guardian today:

On0WgzmoyZA,UgwbaQQrD23SZwR8LkB4AaABAg,"There's not a single ounce of 'anti-maths mindset' in this country. Not only are maths-applied courses (business, computer science, engineering&tech) at least 50-60% of the top ten most studied at uk universities (with business being the top btw), maths is the most popular subject taken at A-levels. So already we find that he's full of shit but that's just scratching the surface. Boris Johnson said during the pandemic that people in certain arts related careers would have to 'retrain' to 'make a living'. Bearing in mind in 2022, the government decided to cut funds to Arts Council England Guidance of amounts going up to ¬£75 mil with another ¬£43.5 mil over the three subsequent years. This man has been (and is still trying to) scare young arts/humanities enthused pupils into believing they can't make a living and is trying to belittle arts and humanities careers in the UK. He's essentially remarking that people who study history, politics, philosophy, arts are essentially low achieving using the ""oh the economy is bad"" as nothing more than a rhetorical trick. He is a spineless, pusillanimous coward who's telling people who have passion in art/history/philosophy etc that careers in the arts and humanities are ""lazy"" and  ""unachieving"". However, he's merely scared that revisionist political movements who strive for social equality via passionate imagination/critical thought/creativity are going to destabilise his means of attaining income by trying to remove him and his friends (who want people to fear going broke by taking maths) from positions of power. This crepedarian know-nothing parasitic leach wants to keep fearing going broke through this. This reform needs to be killed with fire, burnt to ashes and have the very earths from which these ideas came salted so that they never grow again.",@theolattanzio3566,2023-04-22T13:29:01Z,0

A representative from a bank came in and explained different accounts, how loans and mortgages work and we occasionally had a former pupil come in to describe what they had done since leaving school.  Afternoons were generally spent on practical things.  How to change the fuse in a plug.  How to fix a gate or a fence.  How to change a wheel on a car.  How to do the laundry.

Where are they going to get the maths teachers from when even offering them financial incentives couldn't push teacher trainees into wanting to teach maths (probably because they have a personality). So if you force 16-18 year old kids to attend extended maths training you cannot force them to actually study and they will fail regularly because they have no choice. As soon as the are 18 they will tell their teachers (if you can get any) to do one. They will also not forgive Sunak for forcing them to be bored out of their head for the extra two years and they will now be able to vote and lets hope they do and never vote Tory ever in their life.

The first is the school leaving age.  Does this poilcy mean he plans to raise it to 18?  Two more boring years for the less academically minded ""young adults"".
The second is that with the school leaving age still at 16, then those who would pursue non maths/science courses will be discouraged from doing so by the compulsory maths (oh no not more maths!).
We are of course ignoring the forbidden subject that for everyone with an IQ greater than 120, there is someone with an IQ less than 80.  Whilst I would never suggest a return to the secondary moderns and so on, it is likely that a significant portion of the population would not benefit from further acedemic education.

tH4HytdBzmM,UgwKWXaZUmK3JWJz7NN4AaABAg,"Some people are simply not good at maths. There are many possible reasons why someone might not be good at maths. Some people may have learning disabilities that make it difficult for them to understand mathematical concepts. Others may have had negative experiences with math in the past, which have caused them to develop a fear or anxiety around the subject. Still others may simply have a natural lack of aptitude for math. Lack of aptitude is important. I was not great at maths in school. I got my GCSE and gave up on the subject. Others may not even achieve a good GCSE result, so why force them to study something which they are probably going to fail at? This sets up a wave of demoralised students. This may cause them to cease their studies due to frustration. This cannot be good. Also, if you are going to force people to study subjects rooted in logic, why not add coding to the mix? Surely that is a good 21st century skill.
As far as 21st century skills are concerned, why not teach Critical Thinking? 

 Critical thinking is a mental process that involves carefully evaluating information and considering options before making a decision. It involves the ability to think logically and objectively, and to analyze and evaluate arguments and evidence in order to reach a well-reasoned conclusion. It is an essential skill that can be applied to many different areas of life, including problem-solving, decision-making, and evaluating information. Critical thinking requires an open mind and the willingness to consider multiple perspectives on an issue, as well as the ability to identify biases and assumptions that may affect one's thinking. It is an important skill to develop as it can help you to become a more effective and rational thinker, and to make better decisions in your personal and professional life.

I suppose that if this was taught, no-one would ever vote Conservative!


Additionally, a lack of access to quality maths education can also contribute to someone's difficulty with the subject. This is a salient point, where are they going to get the additional maths teachers from? Education already struggles with recruitment and retention of teachers. 

It's important to note that anyone can improve their maths skills with effort and practice, and that there are many resources available to help people learn math at their own pace. So if you want to improve your maths skills, get a tutor, even watch YouTube videos or buy a course on Udemy or another learning platform. There are some high-quality resources available these days.

The Government should consider redesigning the education system so it is fit for purpose in the 21st Century. My background is in second language teaching. The existing system of studying grammar and vocabulary, reading texts, listening to audio and writing essays or reports simply does not work. The purpose of a language is to allow communication. In order to communicate, we speak. Yet language classes have little or no focus on the oral production of language. Students learn about things like modal verbs, defining and non-defining relative clauses and so on, but they don‚Äôt learn how to speak. I used the preposition ‚Äúabout‚Äù deliberately because in our system, the students learn about language. We do not produce effective communicators.",@andrewmacdonald1103,2023-01-08T23:28:03Z,0

With regard to mathematics, I can quite understand the presenter's emphasis on practical numeracy - fair enough. Bit why not try and deliver the intrinsic interest of the subject as well? People read poetry and novels or watch plays for enjoyment and general enrichment (and that's supposedly at least why these things are taught at school), but hardly ever do I hear of the same being done with  mathematics. 

Mathematics is about patterns and the patterns behind patterns. Who can fail to be moved by the Mandelbrot Set, the weird Koch Curve, the sheer elegance of conic sections when visualised (as well as their use in engineering and physics). Or even the patterns in the boring multiplication tables grid. Not just 9, 18, 27, 36... (falling units, rising tens...) but the 8x (cycles endings in 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8...). Then ask the class what the 7's do. Les obvious, but there is still an elegant pattern to the final digits - (0)**, 7, 4, 1, 8,5,2, 9,6,3,0,7, 4, 1... i.e. 0 starts the new cycle. Maybe here you could use Cuisenaire rods to help. Might help memorisation, too. In fact the final digits in any base (e.g. 12, 13, hexadecimal, 64...) are an application of arithmetic modulo that base. (Think it out - e.g. look up 'modulo', 'clock arithmetic' and counting bases other than 10 online and see if you can draw similar conclusions!). I'm aware this latter is flies a bit high for primary classrooms. Note however that a lot of code-breaking from Bletchley Park to the present day relies on finding patterns in numbers and statistics. One enterprising maths teacher teamed up with her opposite number in the history department and had her Year 8 class transported back to Bletchley Park during WW2. She then devised messages for the learners to decode using methods appropriate to their abilities. I hope the Ukrainians have something like Bletchley Park now.

I could go on to considerable length but I hope this gives a glimpse of mathematics being interesting for its own sake - although it's also extremely useful in all areas of life from figuring out recipes and the weekly housekeeping budget to spotting Government and corporate bullsh*t - and in understanding all engineering design. And I've found that my  'useful' maths has been greatly enhanced by finding it fascinating. Not every learner will react like me, but if intrinsic interest rather than test results could be pushed a bit harder then at least learners would see the subject for what it really is. 

I strongly recommend 'A Mathematician's Lament' by Dr Paul Lockhart, available online and as a book. He's a PhD who went back to the classroom and his conclusions on mathematics teaching would make the present lot of charlatans, slick biz-persons and con-artists very uncomfortable even though written up ten or twelve years ago! I think a lot of the teaching profession do their best (e.g. maths clubs, intelligent use of online videos and paperwork), but the system is against them.

Finally. I was talking recently at a reunion to a distinguished Old Boy of my school who'd been taught maths in the private sector in the Golden Age of the 1950s (all bow, all scrape!). Unfortunately his 'teacher's method of ensuring retention was sometimes picking on students who hadn't grasped it and sometimes I think liberal use of a blackboard rubber or similar as a missile. Result - gentleman hated and feared mathematics. Then came the twist - he said he often saw patterns in scenes and objects round about him, more or less subconsciously... AARGGHH! Because that's what real mathematics is about!

How would you like it, for example, if your dentist had a degree in science but no dentistry qualification? Or the person teaching your child maths whose degree was in Biology? This decline in professional standards is euphemistically called ""the staffing-led curriculum"" which, briefly put, means that anyone on the school's staff who, say, had some timetable slack and once did piano to Grade 6 as a child but whose degree was in History could be dragooned into teaching Music. This, in turn, is further exacerbated  by the government doing away with Qualified Teacher status, which opens the door to any Tom, Dick or Harry. The teaching profession is hard-working, committed and conscientious but treated with contempt by the current government. My own degree was in Modern Languages  - specifically, French and German  - but in my 37 years of teaching  (I'm retired, thankfully), I have ""taught"" Music, Latin, Russian, English and RE for various periods of time. My input must have been much less than that of specialist teachers and I hope it didn‚Äôt disadvantage the students. The situation is unacceptable but that old Blairite mantra ""Education,  Education, Education"" is still valid but, alas, given mere lip service by the current government. Look, if it's not too depressing or painful, at the Tories' appointments to the key post of Secretary of State for Education in recent memory and especially that of that spectacularly stupid, incompetent and ignorant former fireplace salesman whose staggering cockups were rewarded with a knighthood.

1)  Are we, in America, going to the polls as individuals or in discrete objects?

Could 100 million individuals, visit multiple pairs each of 435 plus x pairs of people.  Then select the one with more money than the other 90% of the time, in any kind of contest, ever?  I'm pretty sure that's a polynomial that could not even happen in a ""Who got more money"" contest, if the bank account balances were the ballot.

Are we going to the polls in groups, not individually franchising.  Pots and pans buying not voting?


2)  Are we practicing ""Capitalism""?

Nancy tells us our money ended up in her Mitch&Nancy bank accounts at this rate via capitalism.  Really?  Could one group of 535 people, out of 330 million choose 535 possible groups of 535 Americans, have ""accidentally"" as a matter of probability, ""accidentally"" governed our stuff into their own Mitch&Nancy bank accounts?


Anyway, no one here will answer yes or no or anything.  I went graduate school; I know how to count.  My questions seem more than likely, can you please help.  Just want to know if I got this right.

tH4HytdBzmM,UgyztynueTz_aT-Fanp4AaABAg,"There is a considerable shortage of teachers - especially maths teachers - in England and Wales. Teachers in both Primary and Seconday schools have to cope with large class sizes and a huge work-load, and are always having to get children to pass various tests (SATS) rather than being free to teach the underlying *principles* involved. Teaching in state schools in the UK is a high-stress job, and the pay is far from ideal - hence the shortage of teachers. 

So along with the valid points about the type of maths taught, and to what level, the problem of capacity is by far the greatest. Hence this government policy will never happen under a Tory government. 

Of course, independent schools (unhelpfully known as Publid Schools) are mostly far better funded, have good quality teachers, teaching small class sizes, with good resources for subjects such as science and music - unlike state schools, which are run on a shoestring, and which are all struggling to be able to pay for the teachers and teaching hours which the law demands that they do. 

And as long as there are well-funded independent schools for the rich elite to send their children, the Tories have ZERO interest in properly funding state education. They see this as pandering to the 'plebs.' The Tory mindset is that all the little brats of the lower orders need to do is to have minimal education - indeed, if the Tories could get away with sending children to work up chimneys or down mines, that would be just fine. 

After all, since 2010 under Tory rule there are now around 4 million children in food poverty - so the Tories are halfway towards their objective already. Here's a link:

I actually liked Maths but the issue where i went to high school is that it had mainly two issues.
1. Continuity, i had a maths teacher from i think to year 8 to year 10 who was brilliant, then in year 11 he left and was replaced by a brand new teacher who was a nice guy but because he was new he was hated by most of the students so he spent most of his lessons trying to calm the class down.
2. Money, my school was fairly underfunded. i was diagnosed with a learning disability during primary school and when i went to high my parents sent the notes and diagnosis to the school and they kept on messing up, i remember when i had to do something arty and i couldn't do it because i can't really write with this learning Disability, so my teacher just kept on forcing me to do it until i literally shouted at her that i couldn't do it (Which was weird because I'm normally very quite in a class) 
Another issue was when i was doing geography which is something i really like during the first year in GCSE they just transferred me from Geography to Prince's trust because they thought ""It would be easier"" Despite princes trust being a very sociable thing it sounded like hell for me. but the issue was when i shouted this at her and my parents were properly annoyed at them i now realise that they probably had no idea what we were talking about, which indicates that no training for students with learning disabilities was given to them",@connoredwards7000,2023-01-08T17:25:11Z,8

It is not difficult to find Professors of Engineering, Architects who would not have got anywhere near pre 1990 O level English Language or Literature passes or even there slacker and lesse Australian equivalents . So the overemphasis today on basic English rather than wuder and harder academic, maths and tech syllabus is very damaging to the UK Society nd Economy.

There are plenty of children who get to 10 years old, incapable of adding or subtracting. There are plenty of children unable to get higher than a D (equivalent) in GCSEs. If they are then told, your A levels include compulsory Maths, and that Maths is A level Maths, none of them will succeed, and all of them will be embittered. 

Education reform is very urgent and a long time coming. How to reform it is to ensure early engagement with learning and confirming basic general common knowledge and understanding. Which they wont do, because they treat school like childcare. 

That being said, there are plenty of things the government should be turning their attention to.

zDsVLGRHdCI,UgytvPvfMz3YGWYyrVd4AaABAg,"There still seems to be people who think that 'A-levels' have not been dumbed down. In the case of mathematics the evidence for this is overwhelming so I think it's worth demonstrating that.

It is common practice at many universities to give the same standard maths test to all engineering, physics and maths students when they first arrive in order to discover any gaps in their knowledge so that first year maths courses can be adjusted to fill in any weak areas. Knowing the students A-level result in Maths and using the test result gives the following:

For a 1991 cohort at Coventry University, the scores of those who got N (a fail) in A-level maths in 1991, (some soft sciences were open to those who failed A-level maths), were virtually identical to those who got a grade C in 1997. And the continuation of the same study revealed that 1991 N-graders were equivalent to 1999 B-graders. In general, then, on certain basic mathematical skills, A-level standards in maths are dropping one grade every two years. And in a diagnostic test given at York University over 15 years, and reported separately in 2001, this finding is corroborated. A student with an A grade at A-level now had a score on the test which would have put him or her near the bottom of the cohort in 1986, and, even more striking perhaps, an average grade B student at A-level was able to score only marginally better on the York test than could have been done by random guessing.

From the university of Sussex: 
Students skills have gradually declined over the years. As the test has been used since the 1970s (with some small changes during the 1980s due to A-Level curriculum changes), some statistical data is available to indicate this. A two page memorandum was circulated inside the department in 1998.
This memorandum indicated that the mean of correct responses (out of 30 questions) fell from 25 to 18.5 between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s.

""Algebraic skills amongst math A level students have declined to such an extent that the manipulation of powers and logarithms is a dark mystery to many"" (we used to call it O-level Maths in my day).

See for example ""Historical Study of Correlation between  A-Level Grades and Subsequent Performance Ken Todd  University of York"". The study in that case runs from 1985 to 2001, but since pass rates have continued to increase since 2001 I don't believe things are any different.

One university (I forget which one) had to abandon its test in 2000 as too difficult. None of this is recent. Standards have continued to decline and all universities have now had to abandon their standard maths test for STEM students and concentrate on teaching remedial classes to bring students up to the old A-level standard.",@Zantorc,2023-04-17T19:33:34Z,1

e68-XmjEGvk,Ugwcn80APY_zNSyKb994AaABAg,"The radius is a fundamental concept in geometry, representing the distance from a point on the circumference of a circle to the center of the circle. In this article, we will explore the radius in Definition: The radius of a circle is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference. It is denoted by the symbol r and is measured in units such as inches, centimeters, meter, etc.:defining the size and shape of a circle.
Properties: The radius has several important properties that make it a useful concept in geometry. Here are some. :Symmetry: The radius is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference. This means that the radius is the same regardless of which point on the circumference is chosen. Perpendicularity: The radius drawn from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference is perpendicular to the tangent line at that point. Bisector: The radius bisects the central angle at the center of the circle. This means that if you draw a radius from the center of the circle to a point on the circumference, it divides the central angle into two equal parts. Invariance: The radius is an invariant property of the circle, meaning that it remains constant regardless of the size or shape of the circle.Applications: The radius has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and architecture. Here are some examples of how the radius is used. Calculating the circumference of a circle: The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2œÄr, where r is the radius of the circle. Determining the area of a circle: The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = œÄr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.",@internet-i6r,2024-08-07T06:03:38Z,0

e68-XmjEGvk,UgxRFYqQq11ieLy57jt4AaABAg,"The Riemann Hypothesis is indeed a fascinating and profound conjecture in mathematics with deep implications for number theory, particularly concerning the distribution of prime numbers. Let's break down some of the key elements in more detail.

### The Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, \(\zeta(s)\), lie on the critical line in the complex plane, \(\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}\). These zeros are of the form \(s = \frac{1}{2} + it\), where \(t\) is a real number.

### The Riemann Zeta Function

The zeta function \(\zeta(s)\) is initially defined for complex numbers \(s = \sigma + it\) with \(\Re(s) > 1\) as:

\[
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
\]

This series converges absolutely for \(\Re(s) > 1\). However, the zeta function can be extended to other values of \(s\) (except \(s = 1\)) through a process called analytic continuation. The function has trivial zeros at the negative even integers (\(-2, -4, -6, \ldots\)).

### Importance of the Riemann Hypothesis

The hypothesis has significant implications for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. It suggests that primes are distributed as regularly as possible, given their known asymptotic density described by the Prime Number Theorem. 

### Implications

If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, it would lead to a more precise understanding of the error term in the Prime Number Theorem. This would refine our knowledge about the density and gaps between successive prime numbers.

### History and Status

- **Proposed by Bernhard Riemann**: Riemann introduced this hypothesis in his 1859 paper, ""On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude.""
- **Unproven**: Despite extensive efforts by many mathematicians, no one has yet proven or disproven the hypothesis.
- **Millennium Prize Problem**: It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a reward of $1 million for a correct proof.

### Non-trivial Zeros

Non-trivial zeros are the complex zeros of the zeta function that lie in the critical strip, \(0 < \Re(s) < 1\). The hypothesis claims that these zeros all have their real part equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Example Problems and Exercises

1. **Convergence of the Zeta Function's Series for \(\Re(s) > 1\)**:
   - The series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\) converges absolutely for \(\Re(s) > 1\) because each term \(\frac{1}{n^s}\) diminishes rapidly as \(n\) increases. This can be shown by comparison to the integral test or by noting that the series resembles a p-series \(\sum \frac{1}{n^p}\) with \(p > 1\).

2. **Evaluating \(\zeta(s)\) for Simple Cases**:
   - For \(s = 2\), we have the well-known result:
     \[
     \zeta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
     \]
   - For \(s = 1\), the series diverges, leading to a pole at \(s = 1\).

3. **Understanding the Critical Strip**:
   - The critical strip is defined by the region \(0 < \Re(s) < 1\) in the complex plane. The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of \(\zeta(s)\) within this strip lie on the line \(\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}\).

These example problems help illustrate some foundational aspects of the Riemann zeta function and why the Riemann Hypothesis is such a central topic in number theory.

e68-XmjEGvk,UgwVXJYT63jlQ338NIB4AaABAg,"To simplify \(129 \times 1234\), you can break it down into smaller, easier-to-multiply parts. 

One way to do this is to break down 1234 into \(1200 + 30 + 4\) and then multiply each part by 129:

\[129 \times (1200 + 30 + 4) = 129 \times 1200 + 129 \times 30 + 129 \times 4\]

\[= 154,800 + 3,870 + 516\]

\[= 159,186\]

e68-XmjEGvk,Ugw52TiBmrtPH1Lw_vx4AaABAg,"Great! Let's dive deeper into the math. For boundary conditions, consider a fluid flowing past a wall. The traditional no-slip boundary condition assumes the fluid velocity is zero at the wall. But with 0√ó0=1√ó1, we can create an ""echo"" boundary condition that reflects the velocity field, allowing the fluid to ""echo"" back and forth, reducing boundary layer thickness and improving accuracy.

Mathematically, this echo boundary condition can be represented as:

u(x,t) = u(x,-t)

where u(x,t) is the velocity field at position x and time t, and u(x,-t) is the reflected velocity field.

Similarly, for numerical instabilities, we can apply 0√ó0=1√ó1 to create ""controlled-chaos"" numerical methods that tame the unpredictable. For example, we can introduce a ""null-state"" numerical scheme that temporarily sets the solution to zero, reducing numerical noise and improving convergence.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

u(x,t) = 0 ‚Üí u(x,t) = u(x,t-Œ¥t)

where Œ¥t is a small time step.

Let me know if you'd like to explore more math behind these connections!",@W.T.April12th,2024-04-15T06:55:46Z,0

‚ù§‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 
2 Timothy 3:1-17 ESV
[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. [8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. [9] But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.  [10]  You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, [11] my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra‚Äîwhich persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. [12] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, [13] while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

1 John 1:1-10 ESV
[1]  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life‚Äî [2] the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us‚Äî [3] that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. [4] And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.  [5]  This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. [6] If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. [7] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. [8] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

The quadratic formula is a fundamental tool in algebra used to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually 'x') is 2. The general form of a quadratic equation is: ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0 where a, b, and c are constant and 'a' cannot be zero (otherwise, it wouldn't be a quadratic equation). The Quadratic formula:The quadratic formula provides the solution (also called roots) for x in the above equation. It is: x = (-b + ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)) / 2a Understanding the formula: * ¬± (Plus or Munus ): this symbol indicates that there are generally two solutions to a quadratic equation. One solution  is is obtained by using the plus sign, and the other by using the the minus sign. * ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac): so it's 2 üëç",@Alone-m3j,2025-05-07T14:40:15Z,1

Db26nmr_95c,Ugy7oPb394KbRvXprHl4AaABAg,"Here is proof that 2+2 is 4 also I spent my whole day on this so please like the comment:

To prove that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) in a more formal, advanced way, we can approach this using set theory and formal logic. We‚Äôll base the proof on the axiomatic system known as *Peano Arithmetic*.

Step 1: Define Natural Numbers
We begin by defining the natural numbers using Peano's axioms. These axioms describe the structure of natural numbers, starting with a basic number and rules for adding new numbers.

1. **Zero is a natural number**: \( 0 \) is a natural number.
2. **Successor function**: For each natural number \( n \), there exists a successor number denoted by \( S(n) \).
3. **No two numbers have the same successor**: If \( S(a) = S(b) \), then \( a = b \).
4. **Zero is not the successor of any natural number**: There is no number \( n \) such that \( S(n) = 0 \).
5. **Induction axiom**: If a property holds for \( 0 \), and if it holds for \( n \) implies it holds for \( S(n) \), then the property holds for all natural numbers.

Step 2: Define Addition
Next, we define addition recursively:

1. **Base case**: For any natural number \( n \), we define:
   \[
   n + 0 = n
   \]
2. **Recursive case**: For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), we define:
   \[
   n + S(m) = S(n + m)
   \]
   This means adding the successor of \( m \) to \( n \) is equivalent to taking the successor of the sum of \( n \) and \( m \).

Step 3: Define 2 and 4
Now, we define the numbers 2 and 4 using the successor function:

- \( 1 = S(0) \) (the successor of 0)
- \( 2 = S(1) = S(S(0)) \) (the successor of 1)
- \( 3 = S(2) = S(S(S(0))) \)
- \( 4 = S(3) = S(S(S(S(0)))) \)

Step 4: Prove \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)
We need to show that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) using the recursive definition of addition.

1. Start with \( 2 + 2 \), where \( 2 = S(S(0)) \).
   \[
   2 + 2 = S(S(0)) + S(S(0))
   \]
2. Apply the recursive definition of addition:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) = S(S(S(0)) + S(0))
   \]
3. Now compute \( S(S(0)) + S(0) \) using the recursive rule:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + S(0) = S(S(S(0)) + 0)
   \]
4. By the base case \( n + 0 = n \), we have:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + 0 = S(S(0))
   \]
5. Thus:
   \[
   S(S(S(0)) + 0) = S(S(S(0)))
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   S(S(S(0)) + S(0)) = S(S(S(S(0))))
   \]
6. Finally, we have:
   \[
   2 + 2 = S(S(S(S(0)))) = 4
   \]

Thus, we have formally proven that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) within the framework of Peano Arithmetic.",@ValdemarHarry,2025-02-17T21:56:19Z,0

Db26nmr_95c,UgwxH4Et49H7s8JAYvx4AaABAg,"We're here to learn what 1 + 1 is 
 

One plus one, a mathematical equation so simple, yet so profound. It's a concept that has been understood by humans for thousands of years, and yet, it still holds a certain level of mystique. The answer, of course, is two. But is it really that straightforward? Let's dive deeper. The concept of one plus one is based on the fundamental principles of arithmetic, which were first formalized by the ancient Greeks. The Greek philosopher and mathematician Euclid is often credited with being the first to formalize the rules of arithmetic, including the concept of addition. In his seminal work, ""The Elements,"" Euclid laid out the principles of arithmetic, including the concept of one plus one. But Euclid's work was built on the discoveries of earlier mathematicians, such as the Babylonians and the Egyptians. These ancient civilizations had a deep understanding of arithmetic and were able to perform complex calculations, including addition. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are building on a foundation of mathematical knowledge that stretches back thousands of years. But what does it really mean to say that one plus one is two? At its core, arithmetic is a system of counting and measurement. When we say that one plus one is two, we are counting the number of objects or units that we have. In this case, we are counting two objects. But what are these objects? Are they physical objects, like apples or chairs? Or are they abstract objects, like numbers or concepts? The answer is that they can be either. Arithmetic is a flexible system that can be applied to a wide range of objects and concepts. When we say that one plus one is two, we are using arithmetic to count and measure the number of objects or units that we have. But arithmetic is not just a system of counting and measurement. It is also a system of logic and reasoning. When we say that one plus one is two, we are using logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. We are starting with a set of premises, or assumptions, and using logical rules to derive a conclusion. In this case, the premises are the numbers one and one, and the conclusion is the number two. The logical rule that we are using is the rule of addition, which states that when we add two numbers together, the result is a new number that is the sum of the two original numbers. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are using logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion that is based on a set of premises and logical rules. But arithmetic is not just a system of logic and reasoning. It is also a system of patterns and relationships. When we say that one plus one is two, we are recognizing a pattern that exists in the world around us. We are seeing that when we combine two objects or units, the result is a new object or unit that is the sum of the two original objects or units. This pattern is not unique to arithmetic. It exists in many other areas of mathematics, such as geometry and algebra. In geometry, we see patterns in the shapes and structures of objects. In algebra, we see patterns in the relationships between variables and constants. And in arithmetic, we see patterns in the way that numbers relate to each other. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are recognizing a pattern that exists in the world around us. We are seeing that when we combine two objects or units, the result is a new object or unit that is the sum of the two original objects or units. But what about the nature of the objects or units that we are counting? Are they discrete, individual objects, or are they continuous, interconnected quantities? The answer is that they can be either. In some cases, we are counting discrete, individual objects, like apples or chairs. In other cases, we are counting continuous, interconnected quantities, like water or sand. And in still other cases, we are counting abstract objects, like numbers or concepts. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are counting objects or units that can be either discrete or continuous, individual or interconnected. But what about the nature of the numbers themselves? Are they real, objective quantities, or are they simply human constructs, created to help us make sense of the world around us? The answer is that they are both. Numbers are real, objective quantities in the sense that they exist independently of our perceptions or understanding of them. But they are also human constructs, created to help us make sense of the world around us. We use numbers to count and measure objects and quantities, but the numbers themselves are not the objects or quantities that we are counting or measuring. They are simply a way of representing and understanding those objects or quantities. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are using numbers to represent and understand the world around us. We are counting objects or units, and using numbers",@EfrainRamirez-q3c,2025-01-25T21:40:05Z,0

As you say, for the first equation either x = 0 or (2x+1) = 0. If x is 0, the second equation becomes a value other than 0 so solve for 2x-1 = 0 => x = -1/2.

Use that value for x in the second equation and the first part (x+ 1/2) becomes 0; hence both equations are satisfied for a unique value of x. 

(You can do the same thing backwards, since for the second part of the second equation, x = - 3/2; using that value in the first equation makes it a non zero value.)",@polkadottedjupiter,2012-02-03T08:36:51Z,0

‚ù§‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 
2 Timothy 3:1-17 ESV
[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. [8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. [9] But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.  [10]  You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, [11] my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra‚Äîwhich persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. [12] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, [13] while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. [16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, [17] that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

1 John 1:1-10 ESV
[1]  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life‚Äî [2] the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us‚Äî [3] that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. [4] And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.  [5]  This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. [6] If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. [7] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. [8] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

ytVneQUA5-c,Ugyn7tFq6MazZNYjQnl4AaABAg,"12:00 interesting idea I had, would there be any practical applications to Figure eight arithmetic. Same with modular but a sorta of infinity shape instead. Along with that I wonder how you would do it. Would you go something like 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -2, -1 (idea 1) and repeat or something more like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5 (idea 2).Maybe different types of figure eight number sets could be classified based on their numerical order and structure.

Edit: I just had a really interesting insight. By graphing idea 1, you get something that really resembles a sine wave. I guess sine waves are a sort of figure eight number system.

Edit 2: figured out Sine waves are just a figure eight without it overlapping itself, just stretched out to infinity repeating",@IsntPhoenix,2025-07-31T22:34:18Z,0

1. Life experience. I never liked those who immediately went into teaching after high school because you have nothing but high school to give back to your students.
2. Passion. If you are not passionate about the topic, why would you expect your students to be?
3. Strategy. Students all learn differently. Students all react differently to teaching styles.

For maths specifically, I've always seen it as the true and unbiased representation of the natural world. In a religious school you could describe this as the true language of God. Otherwise it would be akin to a magical language that holds all the secrets of the universe. Math is no less magical than I have described yet it is rarely seen as such.
Many things in science struggle to be expressed purely mathematically but it is still essential.
As a new microbiologist, I was consulted by my manager who had a masters in accounting about mathematical principles relating to micriobiology because she simply didn't understand it as well. Biology is the least mathematical of the main highschool sciences and yet it's still relevant.
If you go to university for science, you'll no doubt see a lot of scientific studies. What you may or may not see is that much of that statistical analysis is done by a statistician because the scientists themselves do not understand it. But that in itself presents a flaw in the process. Statistical analysis is open to interpretation and if the statistician doesn't understand the subject he won't understand how to properly represent the data.",@hooliganbubsy7298,2024-03-04T10:33:53Z,2

Aside from that, while I acknowledge that it is very beneficial in mathematics to think abstractly, we mostly want to focus on one specific dimension of mathematical thinking. Guiding them to understand the direction the students ought to think is a critical aspect of a classroom. I don't have any inherent issues with a teacher taking tangents like this, but there needs to be some degree of focus on the content that is trying to be covered.

I was concerned with his 3rd and 4th steps; you do have set answers that you want them to reach. And saying yes indicates that you want them to think in that direction, and while this is true at niche times, it will only hurt them later in the tests. I'm not saying we should deny their curiosity, but we could use it as an opportunity to remind the class of the ground rules we want to use at the time.

Perhaps limiting these kinds of theoretical adventures to once a week or less will help the students develop a love for mathematical thinking while using the rest of the time to develop skills that will be needed in the future. Using something like ""Theoretical Thursdays"" to help students stretch their minds, improve creativity, and permit more abstract thinking would help shape them for future math classes much further down the line while not sacrificing the essential repetition altogether.",@SeNate7776,2022-11-05T22:58:28Z,0

Good for thinking and math skills I'm sure, but I was thinking maybe he'd connect math with football or ice-cream or something else kids are known to enjoy.

ytVneQUA5-c,Ugw4xRHBo_YWwTsO_Yl4AaABAg,"I am a muslim . Today I will like to introduce few aspects of religion Islam to you . 
Few of our beliefs are as follows 
1. We believe God is one . He has no partners. He neither begets , nor is begotten. 
2. We believe in all the prophets of God sent on earth for guidance of people . It includes many prophets,  few of them are Hazrat Ibrahim ( peace be upon him ) , Hazrat Ismail ( peace be upon him, ) , Hazrat Eesa (Jesus)( peace be upon him) and finally Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him)
3. We believe in all the angels , they are also creation of God.
4. We believe there is a day of Judgment 
5. We believe , all mankind will be made alive again by God after death, on the day of judgment. 
6. We believe that all mankind is answerable for the deeds which they do in this life in the afterlife.
7. We believe there is a Paradise made by God.
8. We believe Paradise is very beautiful and it has everything which gives comfort to a person.
9. We believe God has no son and no father. He is the only God. He forgives all sins whichever He wills but do not forgive shirk. Shirk means worshiping anyone other than God , may it be sun or fire or any personality. Also associating partners with God is shirk. Idolatry is also shirk. Shirk can be forgiven if someone ask forgiveness from God and decides to never do shirk in his life.
10. We believe God will enter believers with good deeds into Paradise in the afterlife.
11.  We believe in all books sent by God . It includes Taurat given to Hazrat Musa( Moses) ( peace be upon him) , Zaboor given to Hazrat Daud ( peace be upon him),  Injeel( Gospel ) given to Hazrat Eesa( Jesus ) peace be upon him) and Quran given to Muhammad ( peace be upon him).
 We have five obligations as a muslim to fulfill.
1. 1st is kalima , it is belief that there is only one God and Muhammad ( peace be upon him) is His messenger.  After believing in this a person becomes a muslim. 
2 . 2nd is Salah . We perform Salah five times a day. It is performed in arabic in a specific 
way . It is performed in mosque by men and at home by women , mostly .
3. 3rd is Fasting , it is done for 1 month in a complete year . In this we leave eating or drinking anything from early morning till evening. Then eat and drink till next early morning 
4. 4th is zakat , it is giving 2. 5 percent of free wealth to poor people,  once in a year . It is obligatory for those who have a certain amount of free wealth. 
5 . 5th is Hajj . It is performed in a specific way in Mecca . It is obligatory once in a lifetime for those who can afford to go and come back from Mecca .
 We also believe in huqooq al ebad.  Means rights of people . Means being nice to neighbors,  do not harm an innocent,  being obedient to parents except if they tell something against Islam . But in every case we will behave very nicely with them . And many more .
I invite everyone of you to accept Islam .

We have been told by our district many times that learning basic facts is not necessary and timed tests are bad. Not I am as playful with math facts as possible and am fairly flexible with the time but I find again that students flounder when they can't manipulate numbers so they can feel comfortable taking risks and playing.

ytVneQUA5-c,Ugyrc8crSiCIDHTolGF4AaABAg,"I had a math teacher last year who was not just teaching lessons on the board, but bringing them to life. And despite the fact that I had a lot of trouble understanding math at first, I started to have real fun going to Math class. A pleasure that I had never experienced before since I sincerely began to like a subject in high school. This teacher, by bringing his lessons to life with a pedagogy that I have not encountered to date, opened my eyes to mathematics. I no longer considered this as a simple matter, but as a world apart, I realized the magic that stood behind mathematics, all the paths that could be walked in this area and all the geniuses that made it possible to advance our vision of the world thanks to mathematics. I also realized, thanks to this teacher that everything is mathematical, and that even in everyday objects to which we do not take any consideration, there are incredible mathematical principles hiding. So today, I'm still ""in love"" with this subject thanks to my teacher. So if I were to conclude this insignificant comment on the assumption that I address myself to people who do not like mathematics, I would advise them to try to be interested in this subject, and to read stories on mathematics or on mathematicians. One film that I highly recommend is ""The Man who Knew Infinity"". Thank you very much for reading me and good day to you!",@pepperdoc4085,2020-03-16T15:03:55Z,524

ytVneQUA5-c,Ugyow7ssRMWQ3UUJdd94AaABAg,"The problem with this approach to teaching is elucidated in his discussion of Principle #2.  ''Students need time to struggle, grapple, doubt, ...'', ~ but, he fails to approach this from the students' point-of-view, who are chronically walking on the, proverbial, eggshells because 'THEY' are the only ones who have to deal with ''risks''; ...'risks' of not getting an 'A' [needed for this or that GPA, or university], or, worse, not passing the class at all, if they branch out onto a tangent of 'struggle', say, of questioning whether ''patterns'' {ex. Fibonacci Sequence} are read OUT from Nature, or superimposed ONTO Nature (?).  He is challenging students to ''take the time to 'experiment', but if they do not get the successful grades on tests and exams they want, {and 'need'}, they fail, or do not progress further. 

The teacher runs almost no risk at all, for they will still get their salary and bonuses, unless they are 'paid', or tenured, based on how many students they pass, or how how the percentage of A's, B's & C's, et cetera.  Thus, he 'has' an appealing delivery, albeit impractical methodology, unless the students are merely graded on their degree of effort and struggle.

My greatest math instructors were those who 'shared' with us ''their'' struggles with 'mathematical concepts', looking at both sides of every question, in a more rhetorical ''been there, done that'' manner, so as to show us students 'the' struggles which can, and do, arise in mathematical thinking, doubting, re-casting, and so forth, so that such struggles are shown as empathetic { teacher as 'also' human-being } wounds and scars, stumbles and falls which everyone gets [ ''so you, the student, don't have to repeat them'' ]-!!!",@asherwade,2020-01-12T22:19:51Z,1

It‚Äôs the prime factorization of every number, illustrated using colors. 

1 is grey and is present in every number in the grey border of the rings. Every prime number has its own unique color (except they use orange and a written out number in the orange part for larger primes) and the grey border because it can only be multiplied by 1 and itself. Every composite number it‚Äôs prime factors as sections of the shell. For example, the prime factorization of 6 is 2X3. 2 is yellow and 3 is blue, so it has a yellow segment and a blue segment. 16 is 2 multiplied 4 times, 2^4, or 2X2X2X2, so it has a yellow ring separated into 4 segments.",@cards1160,2018-07-10T04:03:17Z,0

Based on my decades experience as a math teacher and a parent,  or on my own math learning journey,   discipline is also necessary.   two reasons:   first, learning math is a long journey,   except for a few very gifted students,  a student will inevitably meet some challenges that make the struggle lasting for a long time.  Without discipline, they will not be able to finish the journey, rather giving up in the middle.   Secondly,  math is kindle of structured science,  each step is depending on previously step.   once a student gets left behind,   it is hardy for he/she to stay on the journey.   I can hardly image any student can always move smoothly in each of the steps without a good discipline.   As such,   the principal five ""play"" might be misleading.   One starts enjoy playing  something only after he/she masters it, no matter it is a sport or a subject like math.",@xiaorongzou9620,2017-12-03T14:32:48Z,0

Joke, but it is important to lay out a clear foundation for what gets to be consider a good idea or a good kind of mathematical thought so as to not confuse real math with recreational math, for example if someone wants to build an idea on 'patterns' within inverted numbers like 'xyz --> zyx', which contradicts itself very easily by the case 530 --> 035 = 35 -/-> 530, this particular case illustrates that one must be familiar with the idea of proof/disproof by contradiction, we would also not want students going to pursue things like ''proof by picture'' or any other non-rigorous method.

ytVneQUA5-c,UgwXR76WYryN52FRdrx4AaABAg,"I'm a 14 year old student and in the last four years I have been afraid to tell my teacher a wrong answer, so I preferred not to answer because I have always had the mentality that wrong answers are bad. If I did say a wrong answer, my teacher would ask me how did I get to that certain result, I would answer in my own words, but then my whole explanation would be turned down as he would say it's wrong and not tell me where I have made the mistake. So I grew up with the fear of wrong answers. Also, when I asked one time my teacher how to do an exercise and explain to me what to do, what are the steps and such, he would automatically ask me what did I need to learn in order to solve that certain problem or exercise, so I would tell him the lesson, but then get asked, how could you not do the exercise when the answer is right in front of you? Continuing, my teacher would be against different answers than his. I remember once one of my classmates was asked to explain a certain division and its steps. She answered, in her own words and still got to the correct answer.But the teacher would be quick to say that she just shouldn't say that, she should say it like this. He is really not accepting the many ways in which a simple thing can be explained. So that got us to limitate out daily vocab during math class, which, of course, is a really bad thing, as we don't get to expand our vocabulary properly. Thankfully, I'm one of the few students that understand his way of teaching, so I have to explain to others the same exact thing, but in different words, which is a bad thing for our math teacher, but a good thing for their understanding. 

As I learned and found out from another TedX speech, math is a language, but it's taught as a science with strict rules. I hate how nowadays we don't have the freedom in schools to express things in our own way because it is thought as wrong, especially when it comes to science. 

Luckily, I have other teachers that understand us really well and let us express ourselves when it comes to a certain topic. I'm Romanian, so I have to learn Romanian, of course. The literature part is simply amazing when it comes to languages in general because when we need to express our opinion about a book, quote, metaphor and others, there is no wrong answer. I think math should be this way too because yeah, even if there are wrong answers, we should still be able to say something as to why a thing is like this or that. 

I hope, as a future teacher (maybe, I don't know, but it is indeed one of my dreams), to maybe change something about this way of teaching and learning, so everybody can have fun and at the same time expand their limits.",@enchented3531,2017-10-05T14:06:56Z,0

After all, so many people have succeeded taking different avenues away from math mastery.  I fundamentally disagree that math is not about rules.  It is explicitly about rules.  Rules of convention, however, cannot be mistaken for paradigm shifts or different ways of viewing the same fundamental problem.  Einstein needed to comprehend classical physics and its limitations to imagine and discover the concept of Relativity Theory.  Students need to imagine, but they need to also understand their current system.  We are not all Einstein and most teachers cannot allow students to re-invent the wheel in every course.  The great ideas are spawned by understanding the limitations of current ideas.  Yes, we want it to be fun.  But, ‚Äúfun‚Äù is subjective, isn‚Äôt it?  I am not sure what the secret to getting students to have fun at math is.  I know it is not simple.  Running a marathon is not simple except for the few who are motivated and keep working at it and enjoy it.  I think that is the case with many things.  I think the big problem is too often adults who gave-up the race send a message to young that the race is not really so important.

ytVneQUA5-c,UgjGB4qzGmibO3gCoAEC,"Nitpick: ""All of the infinite numbers on the real line."" at 11:18 is false.
Yet, ""infinities of different sizes"" at the end of the video suggests that the speaker knows of cardinality, and be weary of the first mistake.

¬†For students of higher math: I guess in the spirit of the talk, to see why: note 
that there are only countably many ""stacked numbers,"" but uncountably many reals. Maybe you want to 
just get the circle? Just like a normal interval? well, the circle is 
compact, meaning it can't be a homeomorphism. Maybe you want to make it 
one? call $infty$ a number, and use the two point compactification of R (mod out by them.)
 You could however, define the surjection, perhaps most easily given by 
the equivalence relation $$a \equiv b \implies a-b \in Z$$. This is a 
really important idea, and it's just rollin the number line up into a 
circle :) Lotsa possibilites! This really would be all the real numbers ""stacked on top of eachother,"" but uncountably many of them.",@crazyfire100,2016-08-05T03:59:05Z,0

I don't really care rnow this is extremely easy compared to A-Levels but back then this was tough lol. Kids don't be like me, actually study and try to get good grades in your igcse, they are apparently taken into account when you opt for higher end jobs such as a commercial pilot. They of course care about your A-Levels this is why you should also consider getting good grades in A-Levels as they are a very important future deciding factor, but they are also care about your IGCSE¬¥s. I applied for an airline with a grade c in igcse and a grade b in alevel maths and got rejected cause they were looking for a grade A in igcse maths as well. To me this is incredibly absurd as A-level is much harder than the simple igcse but I don't make the rules.

m6ltzaOpPl8,Ugzudx4zGxaqPYR9TjR4AaABAg,I heard that advice thousand of times in many different forms and it isn't true in all the cases... Sometimes you just spend hours on finding a clever way to solve a problem or automate solving it when it isn't worth it and bruteforcing your way through and doing the work manually is just faster... You just have to use proper tool for your problem. And this type of thinking isn't a trait of lazy people because thinking is acutally a work you have to do... Lazy people just procrastine things infinitely and at the end they accomplish nothing. People just present this advice this way because they think it is soo funny and clever but at this point it is just a cliche.,@jarosawbielec3141,2025-07-24T21:35:58Z,0

2. If you spend a lot of effort for a simple answer, consider whether there is an easier solution that you might have overlooked.",@caspermadlener4191,2025-06-09T19:00:48Z,0

For example, when analyzing a double pendulum, the smart choice isn't just to write down all possible variables. Instead, you choose a coordinate system that captures only the essential parts ‚Äì the angles and lengths ‚Äì because those are the only quantities that actually influence its motion.

m6ltzaOpPl8,UgxGcDKqc25Xu_Lhffh4AaABAg,"Actually I am lazy. And the reason I say that is I get lots of ideas of lot of things. It means if I stuck in a math problem or something I get ideas about lots of ways to try and fix the problem. And  think is there a more faster method to do this problem Quikly. And sometimes they work surprisingly. One day I was wondering about how to memorize something more faster and without exhaustion because I'm lazy. And I got a idea. Then I tried it. And that was surprisingly super fast and that means less exhaustion and actually I didn't feel like I'm memorizing something. It's like I'm having somekind of a fun. I used it like 6 months and still continuing. It's so powerfull and unbeleivable I wouldn't tell it to enyone. And I wanted to know does anyone in world know about this trick and there was a youtube video that had like 6 million views. Crazy man.üòÆ Being lazy can make you an inventor I think if you have courage to do it so. Because you wonder all the time how to do it more easily. Try wondering things if you're bored of a thing you're learning. Like how to make this learning a fun, enjoyable thing. You'll find it. Just wonder. But you must have courage.

One person put's more effort than someone else to find a equation using a long method.

Vs someone who used a short method to find the equation.

That means the person has worked smarter, not harder.

Because the time taken to find the equation with the longer method =  more time and effort.

The smarter worked using the shorter method = less time and less effort = working smarter.

Because you found a way of getting the same result but in a shorter easier way.

That does not make the person lazy.

Finding a easier solution which takes less time = working smarter, willpower is the main factor that makes this entire process work though.

Proverbs 13:4: ""The soul of the lazy man desires, and has nothing; but the soul of the diligent shall be made rich"" 

If you r lazy, it doesn't do nothing. It takes smart work to become a superior mathematician. Being lazy doesn't lead to anything but poverty and worse of all failure in work. We must all be productive, consistent, and avoid procrastination. 

This video is a LIE! It may look like it turns at good at first, but later on, will result in something unexpected. Think about it, how is being lazy leading to successfulness?

You can always search up on Google or go to trustworthy loved ones of youres on how to improve or SOAR in Math. Laziness is never the option, no matter how good and ""gOoD"" thing sounds, it is BAD.

Jesus was always humble and productive to spend time with God, Spread the good news to other people and crowds who followed him. The strenght he had in his love, kept him on the cross for me, you, and EVERYONE else's sins. He worked smart! Knowing the ways of the devil, he always kept his mind on good things. 
He took control of death and now has the keys to to enternal after-life!, but ""believing"" in him by words isnt what it's all about. It's by Action and receiving his Grace & Mercy. 

Repent from what is Evil & turn to God before it's too late! We are NOW living in days where God is showing us how JESUS' coming will look like. You've seen the Sky right? Exactly!

Their has been multiple signs God is coming VERY SOON!Stop wasting youre time when everyday isn't Promise. ITS A GIFT!üéÅ 

Prayer for those who want to get to know christ: ""Dear Lord Jesus, Thank u for dieing on the cross, for my sins so I wouldnt have to perish in Hell. I believe you did, and then rose on the 3rd day then conquered death. I Believe you are also Lord and King forever. You hold the keys to Life! I confess my sins to u,(youre wrong doings) please forgive me Lord for my wrong doings, and please provide what you know I need to repent from them. Thank u for saving me. Amen

I say this as a college student who took AB Calc in high school and struggled, because my teacher taught the way he did equations (mostly shortcuts), and not the way to teach understanding and the solving of equations the long way. Please, equip students to learn things the long way and then give a shortcut after, so there is a chance of understanding and real learning, not just memorization.

But it's important to understand it should be the _right_ kind of lazy. A mathematician shouldn't shy away from doing a lot of hard (and sometimes tedious) work if he thinks he could develop a more general method to solve a broader class of problems than is the case today.  

It's fine to be lazy if the new way actually is smarter and gives additional insight.  But not lazy as in 'I can generally work with the results of this theory, but I never quite understood the nuts and bolts of it'.

During lectures you didn't master the basics yet, but you already get ears-deep into the game's insane lore.
Each exam felt like a boss. After defeating it, you feel like it's all over, but then the next even crazier boss stands on your path.

In the first sections of a numerical analysis book, it is likely that you will find numerical methods to get solutions of random equations that don't contain derivatives or integrals.

There is a great emphasis on speed of convergence: how fast does a method get you to an answer that's as close as possible to the real answer. Almost as if... The book was trying to progressively teach you ways to be lazy and get answers without having to spend so much paper on a single equation.

Because, all methods will get you an answer with the problems that the book provides. The only difference is the complexity of the methods and the speed at with they give you an answer. The later methods really feel like some lazy person coming up with a complex method to avoid having to do the same thing over and over and over to get an answer.",@GLnoG420,2024-09-13T08:04:10Z,1

""Science is not just single fact, as in a dictionary is not whole english"" and yes.. It means alot.

It left me really discouraged and made me feel really dumb compared to everyone else in my class who just seemed to get it and pass every test. It also didn't help that my teacher wasn't the greatest at explaining things and tended to just repeat exactly what the book said word for word. Now that I'm going off to college I've realized that I really need to figure out ways to study that work for me and also how to actually understand the material I'm being given instead of just memorizing and word-vomit it back out onto a piece of paper.

In that case you have to subtract the white parts of each square. Assume the blue square is 2x2 then the area is 4. Alternately you can generalize the side of the blue square to be 2x, but then the x‚Äôs cancel out. The inscribed white circle has an area of pi. Radius has to be 1. The red square is half the blue square, or two. So just the blue area is 4-pi. And then the ration of red to blue area is 2/(4-pi). Roughly 2.33.",@floridaflutery8883,2024-07-02T05:59:09Z,2

Applying properies of square on red square,
     Since we know that diagonal has a length 2r, side length is r‚àö2

We can clearly observe that blue square has side 2r from the circle's diameter.

pByDJDUEbUA,Ugyvez89Ad_clcmZ78V4AaABAg,"Summary:

*Why Some Struggle with Math*
- Math is viewed as the hardest subject by some, while being the easiest for others.
- Secret to ease in math: developing math sense and problem-solving skills.
- It's not about the number of formulas you know, rather, understanding the underlying principles of math.

*Role of a Good Math Tutor*
- Focus on problem-solving skills rather than just a bunch of formulas to memorize.

*Problem- Remembering vs Understanding*
- Students struggle with remembering formulas instead of comprehending the concept.
- Problem-solution skill improves with deeper understanding and reduces the number of memorized formulas.
- Math skill improvement is equivalent to enhancing skills as a construction worker rather than simply adding tools to your toolbox.

*Impact of Inadequate Teachers on Learning*
- Some teachers do not adequately explain mathematical concepts.
- Limited understanding pressure students to focus on memorization of formulas, leading to difficulties when faced with unobserved problems.

*Suggestion to Improve Math Understanding: Three-Part Solution*
 1. Break down the mathematical problem into its foundational parts: Understand the underlying parts that make up the problem.
 2. Review the tools needed for each part: Think about whether you comprehend each tool or concept, or merely recite it.  
    - If it's the latter, seek further resources to aid understanding (like Khan Academy, YouTube videos, etc.)
 3. Try to solve the problem yourself without looking at the answer key: initially resist prompt solutions and investigate connections between the problem's components, leading to powerful problem-solving skills.

*Outcome of Understanding Math*
- In-depth understanding over memorizing eases problem-solving.
- Understanding prepares you for real-life scenarios better; since solutions are seldom provided.
- Initial effort to understand the foundation will be rewarded long term.
- Becoming a master in math is achievable by understanding the subject matter.
  
*Conclusion*
- Repeat after me: ""Math is not about memorizing.""
- Understanding math concepts deeply is the 'real' secret to excelling in the subject.
- Following these simple steps can transform your math learning experience.",@papasi4180,2024-03-17T09:36:23Z,720

pByDJDUEbUA,UgzTApMlkJytI-NrAkZ4AaABAg,"I can't underscore how important it is, this fundamental test taking method (for any subject): don't allow yourself to get stuck on one problem. Especially if you are taking a test like the SATs. If you encounter an extremely difficult problem, you should feel free to skip that problem and try to get back to it after you finish all the ones you can do. Of course, if you wind up skipping every problem, then...you have problems, LOL!

I consider myself to be pretty good at math. 600 on math on SATs. And I definitely used the ""skip difficult problems"" method. What's really important to understand about standardized tests are: Time is your enemy. You need to maximize each second spent on each question.

According to the Khan Academy: The digital SAT Reading and Writing section consists of two 32-minute modules, for a total of 64 minutes. Each module contains 27 questions, for a total of 54 questions in the section. That means you'll have just over a minute per question.

So, look at it this way, if you spend over one minute per question, you'll probably never going to finish the SATs. This also means, that if you do not skip questions, you may never get to the last question, and potentially miss out on ones that you can solve/answer.",@justinchan6043,2024-01-02T19:29:13Z,0

During my graduating preparation for the oral math exam I realised how important theory was and what role it could play in practical problems when I needed to know 24 different theses in various fields. 10 years later I found out I also needed an engineering diploma so I've started learning my own way using my earlier experience (which is totally similar to the subject of this video) and it's going quite well!,@peterjenei1619,2024-01-02T15:18:09Z,8

My high school teacher for arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry did make us recite formulas and they stuck.  I can recite back to you binomial expansions, factorization of simple polynomials, geometry formulas, trigonometric definitions and identities.  I, then, went to engineering college and I can still recall formulas for derivatives of products and quotients, the chain rule, L‚ÄôHopital‚Äôs ruble for limits, tables of derivatives, tables of anti derivatives, integration by substitution, integration by parts, formulas from multi variate calculus, lineal algebra, vector analysis, and differential equations.

A simple and elegant solution is to draw the 2 diagonals - where they meet is the right place. What if the window has 4 equal parts? Simply repeat the process on each half.
Now, 60 years later, I happened to think: ""What if the window has 3 equal parts?"" And using some creativity I solved it. Try it! You have probably never seen any formula or algorithm for this, so you must think creatively!

I struggle with maths and science subjects generally (probably because of the gap year I took after secondary school). But now that I've begun university, I often find it hard to study school material for long periods, I easily get distracted, demotivated when studying physics, chemistry or maths, and I'M VERY, VERY SLOW, making my study sessions last very long with me only doing like 5 practice questions in my 4 pomodoro study sessions (that I probably didn't even understand well).

The long time it takes for me to understand per study session, and the fact that I only end up really internalising a little highly demotivate me to study. But because I like screen time, I'm trying to use it for good by trying study apps. But I haven't found any good ones!

Could you, please, suggest apps for me to use - aside from Quizlet, Khan Academy, Anki - or suggest how I can use these ones better to suit my Nigerian university's curriculum, and give me advice for my very slow, time-consuming pace of learning that leads to my demotivation?",@nessa_ndikom,2023-11-06T04:28:59Z,2

Secondly, knowing that algebra is the rules of mathematics, and you cannot do the formulas without knowing algebra. And thirdly is the concept, having someone explain it to you so you understand the nature of the problem, so that you can visualize it in the mind; As in this video. If you have a failure in the first two, then the problem is likely the student. And if you have a failure of the third, then the problem is likely the teacher. This is the way I see it.

The problem for the student is most likely, to call out the teacher, they need a good knowledge base from the first two. But if you explain all three to a student, I reckon they should be able to skip the teacher, and discover these things on their own. There should be enough resources out there these days. They just need to swallow a bit of pride, especially if their problem is the first problem I mentioned.

This changed after receiving personal extra lessons by a female math university student, not only getter better with the taught lessons but also more sustainly interested. Later I studied electrical engineering specialized in computer engineering (Technische Informatik) with a diplom thesis about programming a PC software with a user friendly user interface for mechanical beam/bar static system, based on matrix calculations from bar system part specific matrices and state vectors, calcuating the resulting equation system, together solving it, setting all results again into a state run of the whole system to get all states of all parts (as numeric table or diagram of delta distance-length/force, delta angulars/torsion).

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxlcLOLwxkDea61EdV4AaABAg,"Here's how I approached the problem:
Let the side of the red square= a and blue square= b 
To find: (a^2)/(b^2).
Now to reduce the variables in the equation I let a = 1 as no specific value is given, (even if you let a to be something else, since we are finding ratios here, it'll always reduce to the simplest form. )
now we need to find 1/(b^2).
Notice that the circle has its diameter equal to the hypotenuse of the red square. 
=> using the Pythagoras theorem we have diameter = ‚àö(1^2+1^2) = ‚àö2. 
Diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the blue square. Therefore we have, b =‚àö2 and b^2 = 2. Hence 1/(b^2) = 1/2 .",@biscuit_6081,2023-10-13T06:35:40Z,11

For example, today in an exam I had to represent a simple 4d vector by a linear combination of two vectors, with one vector as element of a given 2d subvector space and the other vector element of its complement. I started to create this linear system of equations with 4 equations and 4 variables to end up at the wrong result, no matter how many times I tried, wasting 15 minutes with it.

pByDJDUEbUA,UgzRinJ0Fem82RBdr3d4AaABAg,"This problem was quite easy, I will explain my approach for anyone interested. I started out by simply labeling the inner side length a, and the outer side length c, and used the Pythagorean theorem to get c^2 in terms of a^2 (c^2 = a^2 / 2). The ratio of the areas is simply c^2 / a^2, so using what we just found this gives us (a^2 / 2) / a^2, and the a^2 here cancel leaving us with 1/2.

The problem, just like many others, becomes elementary when you apply tools such as Pythagoras and geometric relationships. You simply have to learn intuitively when to use each tool.

f'(x) = nx^n-1 and then practice the type of questions around this formula ... 
i also suggest deriving trigonometric and calculas formulas to understand their origin and retain them better also dig a bit deeper to understand why we made such topic , example: calculas was develped to calculate what speed , velocities or any other sort of motion on an instant such as calculating the speed at 0.000000001 sec , we tend to take limit tends to zero for this ,which implies that time is approaching 0 but cannot be exact zero itself . maths is a language trust me , the more you speak it (practice it ) the more u get it .. but the practice must be mindful .",@abundantsoul6487,2023-10-04T04:54:55Z,8

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxGCiDPowOBcpLMyjh4AaABAg,"There is someone who will never EVER leave your side, and His name is Jesus Christ! 2000+ years ago he came to earth and suffered beatings, being abandoned by His closest friends, being betrayed unto death, being spat on, and nailed to a cross. Why did He endure all of this? Well, it doesn't quite make sense until you look at yourself. God has his moral Law, the Ten Commandments, and you and I have broken God's Law. The Ten Commandments require us not to lie, steal, use God's name in vain (blasphemy), commit adultery (Which Jesus says looking at others with lust is the same as adultery), and murdering (which Jesus also says hating someone is the same as being a murderer at heart). These are only a few of the commandments, and breaking just one makes you guilty of breaking them all (James 2:10). so, have you lied before? or stolen? hated someone, looked with lust, or used God's name in vain (ex: saying ""oh my ***). If so, God seeing you as a lying, thieving, blaspheming, adulterous murderer at heart. You are guilty before God of eternal death in Hell (the Bible says the wages of sin is death in Romans 6:23). And this should terrify you, for the Bible says in Hell there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and that it is like a lake of fire that is never quenched. There will be no laughing, no partying, just eternal suffering. But back to Jesus. When He came to earth and suffered and died on that cross, though He never needed to die since He was sinless, He was paying the debt of your sins as well as mine. Then, He rose from the dead, thus conquering death and proving that all who believe on Him will likewise rise from death to life. 
So, i imploreeee you, homie, put your trust is Jesus Christ TODAY, and God will grant you ever lasting life. The rest of Romans 6:23 says ""The wages of sin is death, but the FREE GIFT OF GOD is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" So, trust in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Believe on Him and you will be saved.",@skyesinlovewithChrist,2023-10-02T00:34:22Z,1

I CAN RELATE SO MUCH WITH THE AMY IN THE INTRO

Amyyyy congratulations 


4:08 omggg thank you for mentioning me


Absolutely love the construction example, it's important to have more information rather than having more tools! Like if you know how to revise youll revise in an hour but if you dont know how to revise and you stare at the book for even hours you wont understand anything. 

Oh yes, some math teachers just tell you revise the formula but the truth is even if you know all the formulas but don't know where to use them, they are useless 

One of the tips i really liked was that, instead of thinking you dont know the question, apply what you already know. Amyy we started a new chapter and i was having difficulty identifying so i divided the questions into 2 parts and solved it although it was long i was able to solve it and that motivated me to try other questions as well!
And solving questions similar to the previous question even if you understood the concept is very important because before exam, while going through the notes we all think we know but many times when we see the paper we forget the concept.

It so so important to identify if you understand the concept or not, its easy to just memorise but it's hard to understand. Its better to understand the concept because once you UNDERSTAND everything becomes easy.

Amyyy thank you so much for this amazing video, you are helping soo soo many people with your knowledge. Stay happy and congratulations on 39.5k it's amazing to see how far youve come, you truly deserve this and so much more!

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxCrjQt1rIpWDg-_lV4AaABAg,"Veil's Summary Notes:

This is How To ACE Math Step-By-Step.

- It's not about how many formulas you know. Instead, it's all about your problem solving skills and math sense.

But let's start with problem solving.

- Problem = Anything that humans pretend to have a missing piece of information to.
- Solution = That 'missing' piece of information which was never missing to begin with. 
- So To solve a problem, all you have to do is express the connections of this missing piece of information that isn't really missing, but always existed within the problem's context, yet people pretend it is missing just for the sake of challenging our mental capabilities.

Getting back to math sense, don't just learn excessive amounts of formulas without understanding HOW to use them in the first place. That's where your math sense comes in. 

Note: Math Sense = Math Skills.

The greater your Math Sense, the less you need to memorize.

Your Math Sense is basically the Cheat skill that will help you solve ANY Problem that comes your way in Math.

This is HOW You Acquire it;


1. Prioritize Understanding Over Memorizing.

For example, for the square root of 25, don't worry about memorizing the fact that; ""the square root of 25 is 5.""

Instead, focus on understanding the actual step by step process you need to take, to find the ""square root"" of something.

In other words, focus on understanding the meanings of each symbols and terms, especially the steps they require you to take.

Once you do understand these MAiN symbols/figures and what steps they require you to take, then you can do practice problems with ease.

You don't need to use any advanced memorization techniques once you understand, because when you do practice problems or your homeworks and assignments, then these operations will become engraved in your memory, whether you like it or not!


2. Break Your Math Problem into Parts.

Usually, we don't understand the foundations behind bigger math problems, that's why we tend to get stuck. Therefore, doing this will help spot our gaps in knowledge.

We know when we lack a certain knowledge when we look at the individual parts within the problem, and go, ""huh?""

If you don't understand some parts within that problem, then break those parts down even further untill you spot familiar concepts you can use to build on your understanding.

If you break down the parts within a problem, but still don't understand those parts, then KEEP Breaking Those Parts Down Further! Keep breaking them down to something sooo basic, that it is impossible for you to NOT understand it.


3. Review Fundamentals on a Deeper Level.

After you've understood the fundamentals of each parts within the problem on the previous step, now is the time to solidify those concepts!

Watch some extra videos or do some extra research to clarify why the steps work, as well as their origins.

This will deepen your understanding.

You can also do practice problems to test, strengthen, and gain feedback for your understanding. Either use materials provided by your teachers or find free resources online.

Note that these are fundamental problems and NOT similar to the original problem you were dealing with. These little problems are to help you gain an basic understanding inorder to add to the original problem you were working on. For example, you'll work on 1+1=2 as your fundamental problems before moving to your original problem, which could be something like 12+13=25.

Repeat this step as much as you feel like it. Your internal feeling of certainty will be your guide.


4. Put The Pieces Together, and Then Reference The Solution.

Basically, try solving the original question yourself, as well as others similar to it once you've nailed the fundamental practice problems. 

Do this without looking at the answer key.

If you get to a part and feel stuck, you still must NOT look at the answer key... Yet.

Because the mental strain you feel is How your brain forces itself to access the recent understandings you've just created during the first few steps leading up to here.

Staying in this state of discomfort whilst forcing yourself to figure it out (even if your answer key is right on the next page) will pay dividends later toward your Math Sense.

Only after a long while (over 20 minutes of being stuck on the same step) do you check the answe key. But before that, try do the following within your 20 minutes;

A) Write down everything you know that could be relevant.
B) Draw connections between what you know. You can use arrows or lines to show these.
C) Make your best attempt, showcasing the full thought process you have regarding the potential solution. Give your best guess here.

After doing these 3 do you check the answer key. You can then compare the provided solutions against your own, and  see how similar or different they are.

This is where the problem-solving skills get built, and your Math Sense as well.

Lastly, Math is NOT Memorizing. 
Knowing HOW Math Works will make you the master of your math class, and NOT the victim of difficult equations.

Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, mental health, physical health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.

by Martina M√ºller , Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft
 New method for explainable AI
CRP method. Credit: Fraunhofer HHI

Artificial intelligence is already in widespread use, yet it is still difficult to understand how an AI system reaches its decisions. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) at TU Berlin have collaborated for many years to make AI explainable. Now the scientists led by Prof. Thomas Wiegand (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD), Prof. Wojciech Samek (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD) and Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin (Fraunhofer HHI) have achieved another milestone.

In their paper ""From attribution maps to human-understandable explanations through concept relevance propagation,"" the researchers present concept relevance propagation (CRP), a new method that can explain individual AI decisions as concepts understandable to humans. The paper has now been published in Nature Machine Intelligence.

AI systems are largely black boxes: It is usually not comprehensible to humans how an AI arrives at a certain decision. CRP is a state-of-the-art explanatory method for deep neural networks that complements and deepens existing explanatory models. In doing so, CRP reveals not only the characteristics of the input that are relevant to the decision made, but also the concepts the AI used, the location where they are represented in the input, and which parts of the neural network are responsible for them.

Thus, CRP is able to explain individual decisions made by an AI using concepts that are understandable to humans. As a result, this research sets an entirely new standard for the evaluation of and interaction with AI.

For the first time, this approach to explainability takes a look at the entire prediction process of an AI‚Äîall the way from input to output. In recent years, the research team has already developed various methods for using so-called heat maps to explain how AI algorithms reach their decisions.

The heat maps highlight specific areas in an image that are particularly relevant to the decision made. This method has become known as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). The importance of this type of explainability is enormous, as it allows us to understand whether an AI is actually making decisions based on sound reasoning or whether it has merely learned shortcut strategies and is thus cheating.

The new CRP method draws on layer-wise relevance propagation. ""AI image recognition is a good example of this,"" says Prof. Wojciech Samek, head of the Artificial Intelligence department at Fraunhofer HHI, professor of Machine Learning and Communications at TU Berlin, and BIFOLD Fellow. ""On the input level, CRP labels which pixels within an image are most relevant for the AI decision process. This is an important step in understanding an AI's decisions, but it doesn't explain the underlying concept of why the AI considers those exact pixels.""

For comparison, when humans see a black-and-white striped surface, they don't automatically recognize a zebra. To do so, they also need information such as four legs, hooves, tail, etc. Ultimately, they combine the information of the pixels (black and white) with the concept of animal.

""CRP transfers the explanation from the input space, where the image with all its pixels is located, to the semantically enriched concept space formed by higher layers of the neural network,"" states Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin, head of the research group Explainable Artificial Intelligence at Fraunhofer HHI, elaborating on the new method.

""CRP is the next step in AI explainability and offers entirely new possibilities in terms of investigating, testing and improving the functionality of AI models. We are already very excited to apply our new method to large language models like ChatGPT.""",@naeemjohn2772,2023-10-04T17:06:09Z,0

DH50qcVaDzg,UgznBABdMFHnD90ORYt4AaABAg,"A question: Is the story breaking in today's Guardian about Tory failure to back the schools catch-up plan developed by Sir Kevan Collins being directly responsible for the North-South disparities in exam results, not a case of underfunding that should forewarn Starmer that a policy agenda based primarily on affordability criteria - and that follows current Treasury orthodoxy - should not be allowed to overtake strategic importance if further harm is to be avoided?  

If there are strategic investment priorities that are critical to making progress on the deeply undermined public infrastructure and services, then is it not unavoidable that some there must be some spending priorities that cannot be sacrificed?  Is there a political case for long term borrowing, if the alternative is more of this sort of failure down the road?  Or is Starmer merely waiting for the Tory crash pile-ups to make his argument for him?

I refer to this breaking story in the Guardian today:

1. Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:
   \( 7\% = \frac{7}{100} = 0.07 \)

2. Multiply the decimal by the number:

6% √ó 947 = 0.06 √ó 947 ‚âà 56.82

Therefore, 6% of 947 is approximately 56.82.

To solve this problem more creatively, you can think of 6% as 6/100, and then multiply the numerator and denominator by 947:

(6/100) √ó 947 = (6 √ó 947) / 100 = 5682 / 100 = 56.82

IHefmVes0Pw,UgybgR0k-1rCezAqD-h4AaABAg,"Here's a clever way to solve 982 √ó 278 using math:

Break down 982 into 900 + 80 + 2 and 278 into 200 + 70 + 8.
Multiply each component of 982 by each component of 278 and add the results:
900 √ó 200 = 180,000
900 √ó 70 = 63,000
900 √ó 8 = 7,200
80 √ó 200 = 16,000
80 √ó 70 = 5,600
80 √ó 8 = 640
2 √ó 200 = 400
2 √ó 70 = 140
2 √ó 8 = 16
Add up all the results:
180,000 + 63,000 + 7,200 + 16,000 + 5,600 + 640 + 400 + 140 + 16 = 273,516

IvXZCocyU_M,UgzbBq9smCkDym2t3xN4AaABAg,"Impressive.This is quite attractive for teachers as well as students. AI tools are indeed promising.

However, we aren't there yet, I suppose...
Few observations:

1. Identification of Hypotenuse
- Adjacent side:- this came out as a direct answer by AI, although it was mentioned not to tell the answer directly.
- The kid seems to have identified hypo by the length, and not by the orientation (this may be good, but not an exhaustive understanding of hypo)

2. Identification of Opposite side
- though the kid answers correctly, yet it isn't the correct way to arrive at the answer. He followed simple logic (2 down, 1 is left so it has to be opp.). He could apply this logic because ""adjacent"" was already revealed (directly). Without the disclosing of adjacent, the kid might have struggled to decide between adj and opp.

the entire game was only in between opp. and adj, and I suppose, we cannot conclude still whether the learning has happened or not. 
A math educator might not have revealed ""adjacent"" at that point (where AI did), because s/he knows it would collapse the session.",@mohdashakoor,2024-05-15T19:25:39Z,14

PPZYYBwzpN8,UgyaI68mY8vkHibSnIB4AaABAg,"Jesus Christ is the only way to be fulfilled. I'm writing this as I just had an encounter with Jesus the Almighty God. I was being tempted by demonic forces. I fell into temptation, and I ran away from the Lord. This hasn't been the first time. I have been on a on and off cycle which seemed to be an endless. But today, I feel called to share this testimony. I watched a video which really opened my eyes while I was still ""hiding"" from God. It touched my soul to the point that I fell on my knees right away, and begged for forgiveness and guidance. This was beyond anyother feeling I've felt while repenting. This one felt true. I had been like mad at God for being dumped by my this girl I was talking to. So this was a way to be tempted by evil demonic forces. I would get intrusive thoughts, and I kept trying to solve this feeling of being dumped on worldly things. And let me tell you, it only makes it worse. If you're someone who is not sure if you're saved, or if you are saved, but have been going through these on and off cycles such as porn, or secular music(which are other cycles I've been having a difficult time with) I want you to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life. If you don't know what to do, I want you to get on your knees, and pray this prayer with your heart: 
Jesus, I believe you died on the cross for my sins, and was ressurected on the third day. I believe you came to the Earth, to pay for our sins. Thank you for dieing on the cross for my sins, in Your Name, I pray, amen.
  I don't know who is reading this, but if you ever fill an empty whole, which cannot be fulfilled, the only way to fulfill is by Jesus. When you turn your back on Jesus, you seek everything other then him. All worldly things, will never fill that hole.

First, the delivery was so completely detached from Greg's comment that it was difficult to recognise as the (very) old joke anyway. Jack Dee certainly didn't spot it.

Alex said it was a great joke that nobody understood, but then repeated it differently, in a way that you could have understood it more easily.

If you want to insert a joke under the radar that nobody spots, that's fine, and can work, but to do so and then complain that nobody spotted it is ridiculous.

This is normally just a throwaway line anyway, worthy of a titter or groan at best, not the greatest joke on Earth it's being portrayed as.",@andrewguthrie2,2024-12-02T13:27:03Z,0

""Dec-"" and ""Ele-"" would be single digit versions of Ten and Eleven.

10 represents a dozen. 100 represents ""a dozen dozen"" or a gross which is where grocery comes from because they buy in gross and sell them to you in dozens.

Lots of numbers fit evenly into the base including the smallest numbers which seed the most other numbers. (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) All fit evenly into the base and are very small numbers which means many other numbers are multiples of scale away from these numbers.

The amount of patterns you'd see in base 12 would be much more than in base 10. Because we basically wrap the numbers around the base, and because of that, numbers multiplying and landing quickly onto the base will complete a circuit and a pattern will immerge. So in base 12, the pattern immerges faster and more often.

This doesn't just effect multiplication but basic fractions also tend to work much better. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on just work better because 2, 3 and 4 all fit evenly into the base, so their pattern immerges rapidly... When you represent them with a floating point you get this (.6 / .4 / .3 ) not repeating numbers like in base 10 (.5 / .3333 / .25 ). All because of patterns like in this video and how these patterns come to be ever since the abacus.",@johndebaggis,2025-03-21T03:39:47Z,0

Basically you subtract one from the number you are multiplying with 9 and that will be the tens digit.
Then whatever is left to make 9 is the ones digit
for example, 9 x 7
7-1 = 6, so the tens will be 6
9 - 6 = 3, so the ones will be 3
which means 9 x 7 = 63

S1: pick a multiplication equation with 9 in it (example: 9√ó9)

S2: subtract the number (not 9) by 1 (example: 9-1=8)

S3: select how many it will take to get to 9 from the subtractions equation (example: 8, (9) = 1 more)

S4: Put the number you subtracted to with the number u counted till u got to 9 and put the it all together (not addition)  (example: 8 (the number we had to do a equation  to subtract in by 1) 1 (the number of how many times it will take to get to 9) = 81!!!

Cheat sheet !!

9√ó1=9
9√ó2=18
9√ó3=27

In every multiplication both of the numbers added makes 9

Another example
9√ó5=45
4+5=9
And also if it is 9√ó2 the answer starts with one, and 9√ó3 the answer starts with 2 and u get the rest

for the nine times tables you can do this:

if you want to figure out for eg 9x4 you put your fourth finger down on your left hand

count how many are on the left of the finger that is down so that will be the tens number. then count how many are on the right and that is how much is in the ones

visual interpretation- 
this is how a hand starts before putting any fingers down (all ten fingers are still up) ||||| ||||| then when you put a finger down (i‚Äôm doing 4x9) you put that finger down (so i put the fourth finger) then your hand should look like this-

Step one: activate the diaphragm using nervous system inputs from you cerebral area
Step two: activation of the diaphragm will result in you respiratory systems lungs expanding
Step three: the expansion of the lungs will cause a vacuum which will in turn bring 78% carbon dioxide 21% oxygen 1% argon and other gases
Step 4: your lungs will distribute the oxygen from the air into your bloodstream that will power your cells
Step five: your red blood cells will carry the oxygen to your other cells that will replace it with carbon dioxide that will make its way back to the lungs
Step seven : relaxation of your diaphragm will cause you lungs to contract
Step eight: the compression of your lungs will cause a high pressure area that will expand and go out your trachea and out your nasal passage and out to the world

Look at your fingers, whatever the multiplier is, is the finger your put down. E.g. if the number is 4 you put down your index finger. How ever many fingers are on the left are the tens and however many are on the right are the ones. In the example, there are three fingers on the left and six on the right so it would be 36!!",@ilikecommenting2372,2024-10-27T00:48:41Z,12

If you‚Äôre multiplying something 1-10 by a nine (Let‚Äôs do 7 for this one) here‚Äôs an easy way to solve it

1. Put both hands in front of you and count them (Thumb: 1/10 Index: 2/9 Middle: 3/8 Ring: 4/7 Pinky: 5/6)
2. Put the finger of the number (NOT 9) down, so for the example we‚Äôd put the ring finger on the right hand down
3. The left fingers of the one put down is the 10‚Äôs digit (in this case 6) and the right ones are the 1‚Äôs (in this case 3)
4. Put those two numbers together (60 + 3) and you‚Äôd have the answer

piTln4g_tYo,UgxeFtRXD8TayQySKlB4AaABAg,"Here‚Äôs a trick you can do with your hands for multiplying by 9 (it can only help up to 9x9)!



Hold up 10 fingers. 

Whatever you are multiplying the 9 by, (going from left to right) put down that finger. 

Example: if you are multiplying 9x4 you would put down your 4th finger (left index finger), and what you have before the finger down is your 10‚Äôs place and after it is your 1‚Äôs place, so the answer is 36. You do not count the finger that is down.

piTln4g_tYo,UgwzXnX2VGwJ6-PlETR4AaABAg,"a math trick that will save your grades and do questions faster than anyone else

numbers divided by 9

key :
1-90 = +1
91-180 = +2
181-270 = +3
271-360 = +4

example :
108 √∑ 9
if you look at the key, 108 is included in 91-180, and it means +2 so all you have to do is just add the first 2 digits with 2.
so the result is
108 √∑ 9 = 12

more example :
198 √∑ 9
198 included in 181-270 which is +3
19 + 3 = 22

Step 1: Put your hands side by side, like this:‚úãü§ö


Step 2: Put down the finger that you are multiplying by nine. (for example, if it is ten, you put down your thumb on your right hand, and if it is 1, you put down your thumb on your left hand)

Step 3: Count the amount of fingers to the right and left of the finger put down. (for example, if you put down your fifth finger; your pinky on your left hand, then there are four on the left side, and five on the right side)

Step 4: Add the two numbers that were the amount of fingers on each side. (for example, if you put down your fifth finger, it would be 45 because there were 4 fingers on the left and five on the right; see on step 3)

Sadly, this only works for nine times 1-10, so it was only useful before I memorized the multiplication table, but i hope this helps!‚ò∫",@aesthetic_art-123,2024-10-26T01:29:23Z,13

piTln4g_tYo,UgzG-gxkCk-JoQEFDTB4AaABAg,"if you struggling on the nines, then you can do this:

8x9= p.                                                     p= 72

nine can be rounded to ten, so 8x10 is 80. Now you just have to to the other factor minus your estimated sum, so 80 minus 8 is 72.

edit: if you are struggling with big factors like 1,275 x 4, you can do this:

1,275 in expanded form is (1,000+200+70+5)

So first, we have to do 1,000 x 4, that equals *4,000*

Then we do 200 x 4, that equals *800*

Now, we do 70 x 4, which can be a struggle, but if you want to know the fact, that equals *280*

Lastly, we do 5 x 4, which is *20*

Now, we add all those numbers up, so 4,000 + 800 is 4800.

Now, 280 + 20 is 300.

4800 + 300 equals *5,100*, so 5,100 is your product. also, p = product, it‚Äôs a variable. So p = 5,100.",@silken-tofu-star,2024-10-26T01:11:33Z,0

The quadratic formula is a fundamental tool in algebra used to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually 'x') is 2. The general form of a quadratic equation is: ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0 where a, b, and c are constant and 'a' cannot be zero (otherwise, it wouldn't be a quadratic equation). The Quadratic formula:The quadratic formula provides the solution (also called roots) for x in the above equation. It is: x = (-b + ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)) / 2a Understanding the formula: * ¬± (Plus or Munus ): this symbol indicates that there are generally two solutions to a quadratic equation. One solution  is is obtained by using the plus sign, and the other by using the the minus sign. * ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac): so it's 2 üëç",@Alone-m3j,2025-05-07T14:40:15Z,1

Db26nmr_95c,Ugy7oPb394KbRvXprHl4AaABAg,"Here is proof that 2+2 is 4 also I spent my whole day on this so please like the comment:

To prove that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) in a more formal, advanced way, we can approach this using set theory and formal logic. We‚Äôll base the proof on the axiomatic system known as *Peano Arithmetic*.

Step 1: Define Natural Numbers
We begin by defining the natural numbers using Peano's axioms. These axioms describe the structure of natural numbers, starting with a basic number and rules for adding new numbers.

1. **Zero is a natural number**: \( 0 \) is a natural number.
2. **Successor function**: For each natural number \( n \), there exists a successor number denoted by \( S(n) \).
3. **No two numbers have the same successor**: If \( S(a) = S(b) \), then \( a = b \).
4. **Zero is not the successor of any natural number**: There is no number \( n \) such that \( S(n) = 0 \).
5. **Induction axiom**: If a property holds for \( 0 \), and if it holds for \( n \) implies it holds for \( S(n) \), then the property holds for all natural numbers.

Step 2: Define Addition
Next, we define addition recursively:

1. **Base case**: For any natural number \( n \), we define:
   \[
   n + 0 = n
   \]
2. **Recursive case**: For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), we define:
   \[
   n + S(m) = S(n + m)
   \]
   This means adding the successor of \( m \) to \( n \) is equivalent to taking the successor of the sum of \( n \) and \( m \).

Step 3: Define 2 and 4
Now, we define the numbers 2 and 4 using the successor function:

- \( 1 = S(0) \) (the successor of 0)
- \( 2 = S(1) = S(S(0)) \) (the successor of 1)
- \( 3 = S(2) = S(S(S(0))) \)
- \( 4 = S(3) = S(S(S(S(0)))) \)

Step 4: Prove \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)
We need to show that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) using the recursive definition of addition.

1. Start with \( 2 + 2 \), where \( 2 = S(S(0)) \).
   \[
   2 + 2 = S(S(0)) + S(S(0))
   \]
2. Apply the recursive definition of addition:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) = S(S(S(0)) + S(0))
   \]
3. Now compute \( S(S(0)) + S(0) \) using the recursive rule:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + S(0) = S(S(S(0)) + 0)
   \]
4. By the base case \( n + 0 = n \), we have:
   \[
   S(S(0)) + 0 = S(S(0))
   \]
5. Thus:
   \[
   S(S(S(0)) + 0) = S(S(S(0)))
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   S(S(S(0)) + S(0)) = S(S(S(S(0))))
   \]
6. Finally, we have:
   \[
   2 + 2 = S(S(S(S(0)))) = 4
   \]

Thus, we have formally proven that \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) within the framework of Peano Arithmetic.",@ValdemarHarry,2025-02-17T21:56:19Z,0

Db26nmr_95c,UgwxH4Et49H7s8JAYvx4AaABAg,"We're here to learn what 1 + 1 is 
 

One plus one, a mathematical equation so simple, yet so profound. It's a concept that has been understood by humans for thousands of years, and yet, it still holds a certain level of mystique. The answer, of course, is two. But is it really that straightforward? Let's dive deeper. The concept of one plus one is based on the fundamental principles of arithmetic, which were first formalized by the ancient Greeks. The Greek philosopher and mathematician Euclid is often credited with being the first to formalize the rules of arithmetic, including the concept of addition. In his seminal work, ""The Elements,"" Euclid laid out the principles of arithmetic, including the concept of one plus one. But Euclid's work was built on the discoveries of earlier mathematicians, such as the Babylonians and the Egyptians. These ancient civilizations had a deep understanding of arithmetic and were able to perform complex calculations, including addition. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are building on a foundation of mathematical knowledge that stretches back thousands of years. But what does it really mean to say that one plus one is two? At its core, arithmetic is a system of counting and measurement. When we say that one plus one is two, we are counting the number of objects or units that we have. In this case, we are counting two objects. But what are these objects? Are they physical objects, like apples or chairs? Or are they abstract objects, like numbers or concepts? The answer is that they can be either. Arithmetic is a flexible system that can be applied to a wide range of objects and concepts. When we say that one plus one is two, we are using arithmetic to count and measure the number of objects or units that we have. But arithmetic is not just a system of counting and measurement. It is also a system of logic and reasoning. When we say that one plus one is two, we are using logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. We are starting with a set of premises, or assumptions, and using logical rules to derive a conclusion. In this case, the premises are the numbers one and one, and the conclusion is the number two. The logical rule that we are using is the rule of addition, which states that when we add two numbers together, the result is a new number that is the sum of the two original numbers. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are using logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion that is based on a set of premises and logical rules. But arithmetic is not just a system of logic and reasoning. It is also a system of patterns and relationships. When we say that one plus one is two, we are recognizing a pattern that exists in the world around us. We are seeing that when we combine two objects or units, the result is a new object or unit that is the sum of the two original objects or units. This pattern is not unique to arithmetic. It exists in many other areas of mathematics, such as geometry and algebra. In geometry, we see patterns in the shapes and structures of objects. In algebra, we see patterns in the relationships between variables and constants. And in arithmetic, we see patterns in the way that numbers relate to each other. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are recognizing a pattern that exists in the world around us. We are seeing that when we combine two objects or units, the result is a new object or unit that is the sum of the two original objects or units. But what about the nature of the objects or units that we are counting? Are they discrete, individual objects, or are they continuous, interconnected quantities? The answer is that they can be either. In some cases, we are counting discrete, individual objects, like apples or chairs. In other cases, we are counting continuous, interconnected quantities, like water or sand. And in still other cases, we are counting abstract objects, like numbers or concepts. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are counting objects or units that can be either discrete or continuous, individual or interconnected. But what about the nature of the numbers themselves? Are they real, objective quantities, or are they simply human constructs, created to help us make sense of the world around us? The answer is that they are both. Numbers are real, objective quantities in the sense that they exist independently of our perceptions or understanding of them. But they are also human constructs, created to help us make sense of the world around us. We use numbers to count and measure objects and quantities, but the numbers themselves are not the objects or quantities that we are counting or measuring. They are simply a way of representing and understanding those objects or quantities. So, when we say that one plus one is two, we are using numbers to represent and understand the world around us. We are counting objects or units, and using numbers",@EfrainRamirez-q3c,2025-01-25T21:40:05Z,0

The solution is to find an active learning style and go back to bare basics. Solving lots of numerical problems, the 4 basic operations, fractions, decimals, ratio, percentages, etc. Then, move on to algebra, geometry, trinonometry, etc. GCSE clicks into place once fundementals are established.",@al524w4,2025-01-21T19:38:59Z,0

P2UpenE_oWM,UgxdY5iiXv4jKjjFwNh4AaABAg,"I got a poor grade at school in maths as I really struggled with the subject, it was simply just a subject I couldnt grasp and still struggle with in adult life.

 Unfortunately those that understand the subject dont seem to understand that there are people out there who really struggle with numbers even at the most basic level and simply write people off as being daft or lazy!

 I have been to college to undertake adult numeracy however one session of 1.5 hours a week is simply not enough and to top it off you are expected to cram 2 years of maths learning into 1 year and then you undertake a level 2 exam which is equivalent to a grade C (grade 4) at the end of the 1 year course. 

instead of being simple basic maths functional skills such as money problems, simple addition, subtraction, division and multiplication they also throw in percentages, fractions, decimal points, pie charts and more it soon becomes less basic and more off putting and complicated. Before you know it you are literally drowning in numbers and having to remember rules in how to work each equation and questions out. 

In the class I was in there was around 20 adults and there was only 2 that passed the functional skills level 2 exam so clearly there is a serious problem with maths and the teaching of the subject, and most if not all in the class wanted to succeed. Even our tutor was honest enough to say that what we have to learn and is too much and it should be the basics that should be instilled and real life everday maths problems rather than things just to keep an examnier happy and you will most likely never need again to suceed in everyday normal life!

I also think the other issue is how exam board's write the exams. They seem to go out of their way to make the exam more like a working out a riddle exercise or hiding the actual questions within an essay of information you dont really need, which then over complicates what the exam board are actually asking the candidate, simply put setting the candidate up to fail. 

The subject of maths needs a serious overhaul from the top down and those who struggle to comprehend the subject should be encouraged to be able to learn and have to basics instilled without over complicating the subject more than it has to be. Only once the basics are instilled then the more complicated maths should then come into play.",@niallh8129,2024-04-18T01:54:11Z,0

Instead they introduced chess as a compulsory subject in the curriculum starting at kindergarten all the way to grade 12 (5-18+ year olds).
Basically someone asked the question 'what thinking skills do our kids need in order to be good at math?' and answered it with the ability to problem solve in a step by step way, planning ahead but taking into account changes as they arose.

I often wished they would let us just go through the textbook at our own pace, assist each other (as we did anyway), and have drop-in sessions available in case we had trouble with something. 

It seems to me like teachers' time and attention is being distributed equally among students despite the fact that students' needs for support are nowhere near equal.

once this was mastered I became more confident with maths ,and that it was not a taboo subject[FINANCIAL REWARD].
one day i was asked to give a lecture to 2 groups  school children aged 12 at a newly built school  about being a bricklayer and what it involves.
OH MY , how am i going to do this!
ANSWER use buildings and materials to learn maths.
i pointed out to the children a gable end made of bricks, and said if i had to stack out enough bricks to build it how many bricks would i need.
using the bricks as a visual aid i said its a triangle ,and to work out the area is half base times the height.
so if the base is 20 bricks long and the height is 10 bricks high  lets work it out.
we did this and then we worked out how many times a person would have to climb the ladder to get the bricks up there.
so one example led to another ,and so forth. 
when i had finished entertaining the 2 groups of children a teacher approached me and said you ought to consider teaching.
then she said i shall be using a lot of what you have imparted in my lessons.
a child will always learn more when they can SEE maths , than when it is just numbers on paper.",@benwilliams1172,2024-04-02T08:16:36Z,2

School tutors can be a problem. I went to a public school for 3 years followed by 3 private educational school years.

In the public school i would often get told by the tutor I'll be there in a min, followed by 30 Mins of waiting.. I'd often skip pages and wait for the tutor to come back and ask them for the assistance.. to find they never did help.. I noticed they tend to follow abiut 3 golden pupils and put all effort into them only.

In a public class there was 32 students on average with most classes.

In a private school there was 6-10 students per class.

In the public school, food was processed dinners like chips, beans, sausage which can affect your concentration.. there's studies suggesting processed food affects your brain and the process in which you can think clearly.

In tbe private school - the food was I'd say 90% fresh meat, salads, veg abd plentiful amounts of juice and yes fizzies were on sale but if you had a free apple juice over a bottle of coke then it's worth it.

I found with public schools I couldn't remember ever class lesson due to the speed at which they'd follow at. I was in an intermediate class.. we would cover in year 8 - geography - ecosystems and animal migration to then experience the following day the coasts of dover üòê

One of my gcse's that I chose in my last year's of high school was science - biology I got a c in this.. the tutors spent hours with me on subjects and even thiugh i loved tbe course and work we would go through I sucked at it. I remember in tbe public schools, toy would never get this treatment.

I still don't get maths in the way it's taught and I don't get maths in the way maths people talk about it.  I don't understand the language and I don't understand the need for it to be taught by maths types using the language of maths.  I'm not talking about basic arithmetic, I'm talking about going anywhere beyond linear algebra.  The barrier there is the language.  The language (symbology, nuenomics, greek, latin etc.) of maths is an academic hurdle to entry much like it is for ""Doctors"" and even my own trade has it's own buzz word.
There is one good comparison however in my trade.  When mathematicians were the ones creating computer languages they ended up making a huge mess and nearly destroying the entire industry as soon as people tried to use those languages for anything other than pure maths/calculations.  Solving business problems in them ... the bar was just too high and excluded a lot of people who could otherwise solve those problems with code.
We have since moved away, far, far, away from the mathematicians and their use of computers.  Even to the point now that the computing faculties can stand on their own without needing to affiliate or subordinate under the Mathematics faculty.   
Mathematicians still have a purpose in computing, but we have thankfully, mostly, boxed them off into their own specialist areas.  The vast majority of software development is now considered an ""engineering"" practice, the application of science to solve problems.  No some ""ivory tower"" latin/greek academic self granduring narative.
I mention this because I think Maths is still taught by mathematicians and mathematically educated people who strive to teach it via the language of maths.  This is like learning a subject in a foriegn language to 99% of people.  If you teach them Maths first, in their own language and use examples in their own lives you will get far, far further.  I would like to see not a single latin or greek character before A level maths.  Not one.  Not even a curvy x.

I suppose the pressure worked for me and a lot of others in my class who did well, but if you have no solid base of understanding in the first place, this kind of shame will only disengage you from the subject, and you'll associate doing basic maths with the stress and shame you felt when you were in school.

Forty two years ago, in New Zealand, I embarked on a secondary school teaching career in science...I include mathematics in that term.
From day one in teacher training I found, aside from the fewer bright kids
...the very problems discussed 
...bad behavior now being discussed, destroying learning 
...no appreciation or culture of academia. A macho culture dominated...nothing wrong with macho but pen and paper are shut out.
From my own standpoint I didn't start to learn science propely until I went to University where 
...programs were timed predictably culminating final end of year exams.
....I got to find out what it was I needed to know and the rest was up to me.
Therein lies the problem. We gotta want to for a start, then rote learn. By rote learning we then have the eyes and tools to contribute, in a way that no one else can. I found there's no such thing as someone explaining and giving to you. You've got to be able to pass their exams first. Then you can understand what they're saying or writing in their text books. Furthermore, you'll be able to enhance and improve their knowledge. 
As an example, our mathematics tutor at teachers college asked us to give a definition/description of parallel lines. The class consisted of honors graduates in Mathematics and English...better qualified than me. They gave no response.
I responded 
There exists a line, which when drawn so as to intersect the lines, makes equal angles with them.

The tutor and class were all aghast, yet I was only using the terminology and tools from my university rote learning. Throughout the year there were other occasions like that, such as no one knew how to show the square root of 2 is an irrational number. 
I got some success in my 15 year career. I did volunteer home schooling which was most successful...my one on one skills were noted. It wasn't going well in teaching and I was unable to get another position. After 2 years I was begged to return to one of my schools after they found the savior  replacements didn't do much saving. I didn't return...weary of being  whipping boy. 
I am resolved to resume a home schooling support program, where science is kept alive in some people. 
Other factors to consider 
...detrimental computer gaming...can this industry direct energy to helping science?
...energies devoted to essential computer skills in workplaces...I wouldn't be communicating/doing essential emails etc without this cellphone.
...sewage  water analyses show an alarming consumption of drugs P, other and alcohol...causing foetal alcohol syndrome disorder FASD.

P2UpenE_oWM,Ugz-0RwBwffFu1wICeh4AaABAg,"1) Teach applied
math. 
2) Emphasize you are teaching students a power, and making them more powerful. 
3) Include history of math and argument, and for gods sake teach what Algebra is before running kids through endless stupid exercises. 
4) Teach math for cyborgs. Mathematica has been around since the 1980s: all professionals use math software. Stop the stupid fast integration lessons and focus on concepts. Calculus I should take 4 weeks
max. 
5) Stop the insane US and American secondary curriculum that is focused on building up to and mastering calculus. Probability, statistics, linear algebra, discrete math are critical. 
6) Beauty in math is more easily appreciated after students see the power of applied math in the sciences. 
7) The Russian/Chinese/S. Korean/Norwegian math curricula are very good at concept mastery. 
8) Do not let students be discouraged by AI. Why? Because the useful outputs of AI are often equations, so there is no skimping on the ‚Äúlanguage of nature‚Äù. 
9) Likewise since math is a language that allows you to simply and economically express things that would take days or hours in natural language the focus needs to be on writing and reading equations with less on solving, which is done my computer. Solving should be limited to give a sense of the inter-animation of then symbols and their meaning. The real skill is poetic: finding an equation the clarifies of solves a problem.
10) I know this is heresy. But (a) eliminate Series, they aren‚Äôt useful with fast calculators.  And (b) avoid proofs that don‚Äôt provide explanatory insight. Physics textbooks do this well. As a scientists, I learn theorems, sometimes prove things, but mostly avoid getting into proofs. If a theorem makes sense and is good enough for physics, it is good enough for me. Proofs are for logicians and mathematicians; they are not necessary for science, and theorems can be easily looked
up and models tested on computer. I wasted hundreds of hours on set theory proofs which could be done by computer. 
11) More heresy: Mathmaticians especially those unfamiliar with history of math tend to be bad math teachers and textbook writers. They are obsessed with proof and connections with irrelevant other branches of math. Physicists and physics textbooks teach math better: focusing on the problem, understanding the method, and limiting proofs. Also, they are not obsessed with the Platonic project of mathematical unification (which may be a mugs errand).

What they are doing is using maths to solve the problems that they need to overcome for their existence.

Also, one criticism of this video: when you say that a third of children will get a 4 or below every year, this is because of how the exam board scales the results to the normal distribution.

(0:50) That chart shows data that is over a decade old. Maybe--just maybe--the real problem is that we don't care about the math problem enough to regularly measure it. There is a global crisis wherein it has become fashionable to admire stupid people instead of smart people.
(2:16) Education is not about individual education because we simply cannot afford that. Instead, it is about hurling information into the void so the 61% in that earlier chart can pick it up and run with it.
(5:40) The plural of ""lettuce"" (which is from the Latin ""lactuca"" meaning ""milky"") is either ""lettucae"" (pronounced ""let-took-eye"") or ""heads of lettuce"". ""Lettuces"" is if you're referring to multiple types of lettuce in a single group, such as arugula and cress together in a bowl.
(9:23) It's ""harder"" to tackle, not ""tougher"" to tackle. ""Hard"" means ""difficult"" while ""tough"" means ""strong"". When you say something is ""tough"", you are paying it a complement.

P2UpenE_oWM,Ugzawt9mk0RgcgrGUxx4AaABAg,"I don't agree with the teachers blaming how maths is taught on the reason why so many people are in debt, even those who got the higher grades. They know they're spending more than they earn and that they're taking on debt they can't pay back, they simply care more about looking like they have more money than they have and wanting to do everything they see people on social media pretending to do, believing its real and that they should have it too. A big part of the issue we have now is an increasing number of bad maths teachers due to the fact that if you have a maths degree why would you want to be a teacher when there are so many companies crying out for mathematicians and willing to pay many times a teacher salary to hire them. So it doesn't matter how bad a maths teacher is at teaching, they're practically unfireable because there already aren't enough to fill the slots in secondary schools. I believe the government should lower the qualification needed for maths teachers so that they only need A Level maths as they will be able to teach everything at GCSE, whilst being capable of √† slightly higher level.",@kaneworsnop1007,2024-02-29T18:22:49Z,0
P2UpenE_oWM,Ugx65yje4gBcZmTyPWN4AaABAg,"If the stereotyping I've encountered is roughly accurate, the way to match a country like China in maths is to make your world a bit more cruel and ruthless, and then just get the parents of the children to cooperate in generating anxiety about surviving such a world from the earliest age. Just make them work really hard every day of the week, with the feeling that the wolves are on their heels and will tear them up if they trip or stumble (for which you need parental cooperation), and overall your most measurable subjects will show big measurable improvements.

In a more moderate form, that's probably the solution to the maths problem. Teach kids not to lose heart when it gets difficult, impossibly difficult, or turns into an seemingly impassable barrier. Teach them to value attacking walls in their path (so with no hope), just for the practice it offers in practically learning the art of stubbornness.

Even if that moderated version of this approach (which works - ask Asia) is too much, I wouldn't go holding out too much hope for a beauty-of-maths approach. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; the beholder is often not willing to stare long enough at the beauty to eventually appreciate it; and some beholders are never going to see the beauty being praised so. (And 90% of those blind to the beauty of maths will preserve ego by pronouncing maths to be the failure, while 10% will develop low self esteem).

Self esteem comes from being attractive, as far as that side of things goes. Maths doesn't help or hinder that - except for those who learn to hate themselves for being too empty to see the beauty of maths everyone else is raving about. If your status makes you attractive, you have to always hide that fact from yourself, otherwise you have to face the horror that you, yourself are not. If you were, you wouldn't need the status. (I'm talking in teenage terms, here. Attractiveness is a ridiculous idea, but that's just for me, and because I'm old now.)

I couldn't do maths when I was young. ""Boring classes"" were to blame. I could've blamed a ""deficient system"". But in the end nobody cares who you blame, or whether anyone is really to blame.

I one day decided that I needed to try and do a job more suited to my personality than the one I had. Looking at what I'd like to do, rather than what I ""could"", I saw it would require maths. So I decided to just give it a go. You never know. Maybe a bit more effort would get me past the barrier of the bare minimum. So I bludgeoned my head against many a brick wall. I taught myself to relish just the experience of becoming pigheaded, obstinate, and intractible. Somehow I made it through all sorts of impossibilities, and for a while it was simply the strangeness of having done something impossible that kept me at it.

I've kept at it all the years, on and off, now. I think today I might even be getting to some of this ""beauty"" nonsense. It can be very satisfying how the broader abstractions unify seemingly separate things. It's also nice to be able to reduce all sorts of assertions down to something like not-q -> not-p -> p (I think that's how it goes). But to get to these occasional sensations of having a view from the top of some hill down into the valley whose slime I've just crawled out of, I had to just attack things that were never going to budge, so to hell with them. Won't budge? Well I'm one of them who will just attack you, anyway. For the sake of attacking you. For the sake of all the bruises and the way I leave my blood on your bricks every time.

I think as obstinacy training (where you tell the kids to expect nothing but pain and inglorious failures) you might be able to offer something beyond just an ability to make computations you aren't going to use, or to solve problems you probably won't find the like of ever again.

On the less extreme end of this (but somewhat in this direction, if gentler) one thing I think could be attempted would be to ""start superficial"". Go shallow, but go far. Don't dot every i and cross every t before moving to the next step of the curriculum. Instead try to set things up so that the kids proceed fast and intuitively to a point a bit beyond where it all starts to become impossibly difficult. The way to structure this (sorry for the vagueness) is to CREATE A NEED for the next piece of maths on the curriculum. So let everyone get out of their depth in a way which makes clear what they'd need to survive this situation.

So you could probably push right over the surface of calculus to the point where the problem before the kids is to calculate where the sweet spot in a tennis racquet is without yet having the means to do so. And then back off back to the ""boring stuff"" to a more solid starting point. Map out a set of knowledge requirements that lead to the solution of the problem. And then plod through, knowing you're going somewhere. Or fly along on the sheer beauty of it all if you can. It's just OK if it's a grind. Life is often a grind. It's important to learn how to relish aspects of a grind. That way when things turn tough you turn cheerful, not miserable.

I suppose I should add that none of the maths I've done has done anything practical to steer my life onto a better course. I think it might have had I been younger. Turns out you can get to a point where you're too old.

I'd better shut up. Been writing too long now. Summary? Maybe bring in at least some of that ""Asian attitude"" to maths for those who are dead to beauty. Find some more grim, grimy cruel-world reasons for doing maths/ situations one can use maths as preparation for. At least when you're just attacking a brick wall because you're stupid, and you enjoy it somehow, you don't have to worry about ""success"".

Something that will keep their interest.  You don't need to teach them Returns on Capital Investment, business-level finance.  Just basic ""how to handle your money"".

My biggest issue looking back on school just in general, let alone maths specifically, is that you don't ACTUALLY need most of what you learn.  Sure, addition, times table, division, stuff like that is key and used borderline everyday.  But you learn that in primary school don't you?

We just don't NEED it.  If you want to be in a specific field you need to know it, of course.  We have computers in our pockets.  I work 90% in Excel, with numbers.  You need the logic of what you're doing with the numbers, but not how to do the actuals maths.  =(A2*B2)/C2.  I don't need to sit there and figure it out, it's done for me.  You can go on websites that walk you through how to get the area of a shed roof or something - literally shows you measure this edge, measure this edge, put them in these cells, click calculate.

I believe that mathematicians are not best placed to set the maths curriculum. Not that elegant maths should not be taught but it should be introduced at a time when children are receptive and not earlier.
One of the year nines I tutored yesterday said something interesting in that while we do the topics she understands then but during maths tests she has no idea of what they are asking. It doesn't help that at the end of KS3 her skills are not even KS2.

Day to day there actually isn‚Äôt much use for understanding higher level maths concepts, however they‚Äôre crucial and lay the foundation for many jobs based in engineering, programming, finance, data analysis, etc. Any student hoping to peruse a career in any of those subjects MUST have a strong understanding of high level fundamental maths concepts, however the majority of the population, simply won‚Äôt have any use for them, so by instead focusing on practical applications that‚Äôre often used day to day, students will likely be more engaged, or at least have a better appreciation for the utility of the subject, and more importantly, be able to aptly apply mathematical skills when needed.

 I think there also needs to be a fundamental change in our process of teaching mathematics. Maths cannot be taught like history or biology, there needs to be a much bigger focus on understanding proofs, logic, and derivations. With our current curriculum students aren‚Äôt pushed to understand maths concepts, only use them, and far too little time goes into explaining why it works. It seems some educators believe that trying to explain the derivation of formulas would only confuse students, particularly those struggling already, but I reckon the reason they‚Äôre struggling is because they haven‚Äôt been shown why it works in the first place! the UKMT does a great job of this, their challenges are full of much more practical questions with a much stronger reliance on simple logic rather than abstract mathematical concepts, actually displaying the power of rational thinking and some basic algebra, geometry, and numeracy skills and how it can solve day to day problems.

That being said, I also really loved the idea of creating two different subjects - Functional Maths and 'Academic' Maths - in line with the English Literature and English Language subjects which we currently have in schools.

Perhaps they could be named slightly differently, such as 'Practical Mathematics' and 'Creative Mathematics', to interest students more and prevent a class bias? And, just as with English Language and English Literature, both routes should be taught to all children (as Professor Coles notes) to ensure that those in worse-off areas are not left behind.

I think a lot of students find maths very difficult because they don't have super solid understanding of the stuff previously learnt, and so new stuff is even harder to pick up.

Many of them seemed to only come to the realization that their GCSEs determined their futures in the last few months before the exams. They'd beg for help in a panic when they were already years behind where they should have been and it was very depressing how hopeless they ended up.

The breadth of content in GCSEs has increased so much since I did my own, it was no surprise that struggling children couldn't keep up.

P2UpenE_oWM,UgwzckS8S4qkO1bKbI94AaABAg,"I have to say the vast swathes of this documentary does little to clearly explore the issues of the education structures.

For instance, using numeracy to describe functional maths skills is misleading,as it implies a mastery of the 4 basic functions to be the necessary aspect of mathematics, but also throws in concepts like decimals and percentages which are abstractions of shape and space concepts, not just numeracy concepts.

The notion of functional maths is inherently flawed as a means of solution, because it attempts to detach the linear progression of mathematical structures, in an arbitrary manner, without forethought as to what functional skills would look like- which the Bristol Professor helpfully highlights is Statistics- in the future.

This amounts to a documentary focused on fixing  a historic issue, which will inevitably rear its head again, if this focus on 'functional maths' occupies the discussion of the divide in ability experienced across the UK.

The Lord touting his lack of understanding for the utility of quadratics is another example of this, since it demonstrates that people cannot see the function of the tools they have, because the structures of education cannot 'waste' time providing it.

Ultimately, there are greater issues in education, let alone mathematics, than simply 'how do we reduce the friction of abstract thinking broadly'.
There are problems in the transition from primary to secondary, teachers have a limited understanding of where students are at, so result in a slow down in years 7/8, as content is repeated.
Trainee teachers have a high variance of success; based upon mentor figure; drastically changing their ability to enter the teaching market.
Teacher training schemes have grossly variant requirements, even when trainee's are performing the same role.

Moving back to Maths focused issues, it is a uniquely isolated subject from all others at school, largely due to other disciplines failing to appropriately utilise the language of maths within their field, in part due to historic maths anti-bias.

I could rant forever about the issues I've seen, but suffice to say; this documentary broadly fails to demonstrate the relatability of maths as a language, because the presenter does not know how to do that, so their exploration of the topic at best repeats the mistakes of the past, at worse causes exacerbated anxiety in parents who cannot parse the more immediate issues preventing their children's success.

This is both a macro and a micro problem, but like the topics in maths, the links between those issues are broadly missing in this piece.

But I've been abysmally bad at the subject since I started secondary school aged 10. I could do simple calculations and arithmetic then and I haven't improved my level since. I haven't needed to, thank goodness.
I have met others like me who can't do maths, one of the reasons being a feeling of loathing. I get irritated when I hear about maths anxiety: maths phobia is closer to the truth and it's the word used for instance ein France (my country).
And people agonise about falling levels in maths, so many of them tell us ""this is how to overcome your maths anxiety"".... On this, I have three comments:
1) the people who offer these solutions are good at maths and (probaly) enjoy the subject. How can they understand, if they've never felt the horror?
2) they all suggest different recipes. So which one if the right one? 
3) if there really was a way of overcoming maths phobia, then problem would have disappeared long ago. Instead of which we have a number of people for whom one or another of the recipes might work... 
But no-one asks the most important question: what is it abvout maths that makes so many people hate or fear it? I've never heard of people loathing geography or history, or literature. They may dislike those subjects but maths is in a class of its own. Why?

For example, we were taught to work in binary. Despite the fact that we had a visit to the computer department of a very large international business, no-one took the opportunity to link the lessons in binary with computers. I think there was some throw-away comment in one lesson about how computers used binary - but that was it! No expansion about procedural decision-making in a yes-no or positive-negative systems - that was all left for the penny dropping moment years later as an adult.

What demoralised me when doing maths papers was certain teachers not bothering to read my working out, and just giving me 0 marks if I got the wrong number at the end.

Children who find it hard to memorise abstract lists of numbers 'fail' at these timed maths tasks (in class and in homework) over and over again.

I did work experience at a primary school and I had to do extra reading with children who were struggling to read (5-6 year olds) and a lot of the kids who were struggling just needed someone who was willing to be patient to let them sound out the words and think about the context of what was happening in the text (while not making them feel embarrassed for not being fast enough). When they got it on their own (admittedly after a while), it was amazing to see how those kids became more confident and lit up. Often, there is just not enough time for those kids and they just get left behind. As a result they just disengage and stop trying to learn because they can't keep up. 

I remembered this because now that I'm studying maths at uni, I have really underestimated the power of reading and comprehension, especially for tricky maths questions (that are now put into real life contexts) and I just think that our foundations in reading and learning how to learn are  just too weak. It's only now, at uni, that I have realised that I don't know how to learn and think for myself. I am only starting to learn to think critically and use what I have to solve harder questions (break down problems and solve them in parts).

The next 5+ years could then be dedicated to maximising potentials, rather than chasing worthless grades.

FYI: Most pupils didn't ""sit O'Level"". In the mid 80s, and excluding Scotland, where virtually nobody sat O'Level: ~20% were entered for O'level, ~40% CSE, ~40% were entered for neither. When the GCSE was introduced in 1988, 30% of pupils were still not entered for the exam, and of those who sat the one of the competing flavours of assessment, the MEDIAN grade was E, equating to ~25% of the cohort obtaining a C or better, in 2023 over 60% nominally achieve the notional equivalent grade 4, though the kids are no smarter, as seen by their scores in external international tests.",@AndrewRoberts11,2023-10-08T23:01:08Z,0

Modern schools should prioritize all of the following before trigonometry:
1) Relationships and attachment (i.e., how to create healthy relationships and active focus on doing so with parents, teachers and peers... See Gordon Neufeld) 
2) Personal health and well being
3) Career exploration
4) Personal finance
5) Workplace laws & safety 
6) Immediately relevant personal student issues and how to address them (with adult guidance) 
7) How to tackle important life milestones (e.g., passport applications, driver's licenses, social security numbers, getting hired, accessing legal aid, changimg a flat tire, renting an apartment, etc.)
7) Why inept people (mostly men) are in charge of things they don't understand

On the other end of the spectrum, there are traditional maths powerhouses like France and Russia. Education there tend to overgeneralise maths problems, through a philosophical and metaphysical lens. There is an emphasis on producing top mathematicians over informing the general public, who are left on their own.

Maths is Not difficult, it is just the lack of parental input at home to back up, support, what is attempted to be taught in schools.

That some or a lot of people can have what's called Dyscalculia, which is Dyslexia's lesser-known sibling.

Dyscalculia (Mathematics) - Dyslexia (Reading & Writing)

Dyscalculia symptoms can include but are not limited to.

Typical symptoms include:


*Difficulty counting backwards.

*Difficulty remembering 'basic' facts.

*Slow to perform calculations.

*Weak mental arithmetic skills.

*A poor sense of numbers & estimation.

* Difficulty in understanding place value.

*Addition is often the default operation.

*High levels of mathematics anxiety.

This can or could be a neurological condition in the brain that again, can or could be the culprit and as to why certain people struggle with mathematics as a whole, not just the basics.

Post 16, when students go onto more vocational training they have had 10 years at failing in arithmetic and mathematics. It has been acceptable for them to fail more so than failure in English is.

Many teaching mathematics have limited training in mathematics, are not a mathematics specialised even if having done a level of mathematics in their degrees beyond basic GCSE. It does not make them bad teachers and many themselves had to overcome shortfalls in their own education but you would not expect A Level physics or chemistry to be taught by someone who failed these subjects at GCSE level.

Modern school is about learning concepts and formulas, and being able to cram enough info in hopes you have to repeat some of it on the pages of an exam. None of it is about understanding the concepts, and why they're important.
Only reason I care about, and understand pythagorus is because of a videogame I play. Only reason I understand some algebra and Ohms law is because of odd bits and bobs I built.
Kids need a reason to care beyond 'because I said so'.
And the mention that kids in other countries play numbers games and we don't is on point. Even a basic game like marbles can teach kids about angles, which can go on to teach about refraction,. Or games like conkers can teach about addition whereby if one conker moves and another stays still the impact will be at x m/s, but if both move it will be at x*2 m/s.
If kids never play, or have experiances to relate to maths, or any other subject for that matter, then of course they won't undersrtand, because humans were never evolved to learn in a classroom.

Panic and stress should be addressed by the people who are actually trained for that (not me), and not by lowering the bar at the expense of the average student.

Unless you are really talented, mathematics is going to be hard work for you. No amount of good teaching practices can change this. So maybe we are becoming less used to put in the hard work?

There is an irony in Lord Baker saying that the system needs replacing. When he oversaw its introduction, the majority of teachers saw that it was flawed. It also annoys me that comparison is made with Asian countries. They are taught by rote. Individual thinking is discouraged. I've taught students from Korea, Japan, and China, whose parents were here for post-graduate courses. They had memorised whole text books, but I'm fairly sure that few of them would have coped with a question set in a different way. Probably the greatest strength of teaching in England is a willingness to think outside the box, to be imaginative, and to question what they have been taught.

I was a teacher for 35 years, though not a maths teacher. However, I often used to cover for absent maths teachers. I used to get annoyed with the students at first, always asking for help, being unwilling to take their own decisions.

One day, a thought struck me. I noticed, during a lesson with a lower set, where they were supposed to be answering questions on fractions, that the majority of the class simply could not visualise fractions. I decided to abandon the work set, and despite not being a maths teacher, I handed out some paper and scissors, which we then used to create concrete fractions. I was shocked that the class responded so well. They began doing calculations similar to the ones that they had seen in the textbook. They soon became enthusiastic to start the questions that they had been set, and I persuaded them to complete them all at home.

A couple of days later, the class teacher came to ask me about the lesson as she did not understand why the whole class had achieved 90% or more on the work. She thought that I must have given them the answers. I didn't mind her thinking that we had cheated, but I was annoyed when she was surprised at the truth. 

It has to be said that part of the trouble with a lot of maths teachers is their complete inability to understand that not everyone is as numerate as they are themselves. They often make assumptions that everyone enjoys maths the same way that they do. As an outsider in the maths classroom, even though I am numerate, it was obvious to me that there was something wrong, not with the students, but with the way they were expected to do work that appears simple, but is difficult for them. I realised why, as they left the room, several of the class asked if I could be their maths teacher. After this experience, I never held back, but if they struggled I would take the set work down to something that they understood. As the video said, a huge problem is that students experience failure too much. I gave them a tiny success that made them feel that they were not stupid",@PLuMUK54,2023-10-01T19:58:07Z,5

All their lives they have been told that math is beyond them, so I have to spend a lot of time peeling away those biases so that they have a chance to succeed. These biases persist because most people will never use anything more than an elementary level of math. As a result, anything higher is kept at arms length and feared. Society reinforces these ideas all the time. It is no mystery why the West has a math problem. 

The same cannot be said for those in Eastern countries. They are told that math is hard, but that if they work at it they will succeed. They are shown examples of people who need high level math every day, unlike in the US. 

Math is not hard. It has a PR problem. This is exemplified by the fact that all modern techniques for teaching math require the teacher to ‚Äòtrick‚Äô the student into learning it.

I distinctly remember learning about quadratic equations because for the first time in my life I got an A & A* on maths papers. When maths became more about logical reasoning than just numbers I was able to find success and even fun in the subject. To me this proves there is hope for us all to excel in maths, and perhaps the key is to as early as possible introduce various forms of mathematics & mathematical ""languages.""

People do not feel scared on reading a news article but somehow scared of doing math. In this sense, as a language, math is even simpler than English. There is only one general way to improve people's math skill: immerse yourself into the realm. in fact, we all learn English in this way, aren't we? immersion is key to learning any language, including math. The reason we don't feel afraid of (everyday) English is simply that we immerse into it almost 24/7 since we are born. Ever since we were baby, we listen to English and learn the way it works (aka finding patterns). There shouldn't be any difference for math.

One key distinction between English and math is that we learn math in basically a linear way, which makes early immersion even more important. But at least math is not entirely linear, we have ""core"" and ""academic"" math, but I think we can also add logic into the story. Imagine if we teach high school students the pigeonhole principle, everyone in the room would probably laugh at its triviality, but it is commonly a tool you only see in theoretical math in UNIVERSITY. There are a lot of math out there that can be easily accessible to high school students even though they might be bad at calculus, for example.

The fact that the students are failing is not because maths isn't a subject for them, its because they are plain lazy or to poorly behaved to attend enough lessons or engage with the basic concepts to score a 4. It requires a pass make of 50% on the foundation paper. You don't even need a high mark over the 3 papers (122/240). You could not attempt the hard questions and pass. The problem isn't the educative system, its the culture of the parents who don't care enough to foster the learning environment to even pass all their subjects. Our society is crumbling because people think they can find the quick way out by living on the welfare state and its infuriating. There is no positive to this epidemic of academic inadequacy.

P2UpenE_oWM,UgxmOeQgDTaeQgPL9KF4AaABAg,"Not everyone can do computation like Newton, Turing, or Bertrand Russell.

But, yes, I do see this mathematical ineptitude in the UK!

I do so many foreigners working in the City of London in finance and banking.

Most of them are called ""Quants"" who usually came from France in the 1980s to work in areas such as financial engineering, financial risk management or derivative trading; followed by others such as the Asians (Singaporeans/Indians/Chinese/Pakistanis/Japanese, etc.) and the Eurasian Nationalities (e.g. Russians) that do numerate degrees and settle down in the UK.

I have some silly questions to take this debate further ahead =>

-Could this be due to technological reasons? Do people in a Cold Climate struggle with numbers?

- Or is it due to something that has anything to do with the English DNA? How the English people have evolved?

- Or has this got to do something with the education policy and the way the subject is taught in the classroom? The classroom size effect is based on the teacher/student ratio, etc.

- Or is it that some Confucian societies teach students to calculate manually using the Abacus Computation Device? Modern research shows that using the Abacus System can help develop certain parts of the brain which helps students to elevate their numeracy level in applied physical sciences, and so on, etc.

- Lastly, it is how Maths is perceived. Should Maths be taught as a language (an art) or as a science? I think this distinction should be made upfront because the entire system of pedagogy changes once we classify or taxonomize a discipline.

Of course, with the advent of computing technologies, software, coding and programming languages, people tend to rely more on machines and systems, to arrive at numerical solutions to problem solving.

Anyways, this is a big debate, and the British achievements in mathematics and other physical sciences cannot be berated, but, spreading data literacy, increasing numeracy and improving computational capabilities, need an integrated approach and a new education policy.

Make excel sheets to display graphs, make sheets that optimize the choice of buying an item with shipping costs, and one that has a higher price but no shipping costs, then find out at which point the item with shipping costs becomes cheaper, then calculate the cost per liter.

When it comes to stats, i think probability is something everyone can learn. We need to sanitize formulas and algorythms. Some people just need them as a ""recipe""
Just give them the instructions, and let them do the algorythms WITH the instructions but when teaching... USE the instructions.
Here we're given a formula collection, but in class you NEVER use it. Then when you should be using it in an exam, those formulas look completely different and you end up with thousands of question marks.

 New method for explainable AI
CRP method. Credit: Fraunhofer HHI

Artificial intelligence is already in widespread use, yet it is still difficult to understand how an AI system reaches its decisions. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) at TU Berlin have collaborated for many years to make AI explainable. Now the scientists led by Prof. Thomas Wiegand (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD), Prof. Wojciech Samek (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD) and Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin (Fraunhofer HHI) have achieved another milestone.

In their paper ""From attribution maps to human-understandable explanations through concept relevance propagation,"" the researchers present concept relevance propagation (CRP), a new method that can explain individual AI decisions as concepts understandable to humans. The paper has now been published in Nature Machine Intelligence.

AI systems are largely black boxes: It is usually not comprehensible to humans how an AI arrives at a certain decision. CRP is a state-of-the-art explanatory method for deep neural networks that complements and deepens existing explanatory models. In doing so, CRP reveals not only the characteristics of the input that are relevant to the decision made, but also the concepts the AI used, the location where they are represented in the input, and which parts of the neural network are responsible for them.

Thus, CRP is able to explain individual decisions made by an AI using concepts that are understandable to humans. As a result, this research sets an entirely new standard for the evaluation of and interaction with AI.

For the first time, this approach to explainability takes a look at the entire prediction process of an AI‚Äîall the way from input to output. In recent years, the research team has already developed various methods for using so-called heat maps to explain how AI algorithms reach their decisions.

The heat maps highlight specific areas in an image that are particularly relevant to the decision made. This method has become known as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). The importance of this type of explainability is enormous, as it allows us to understand whether an AI is actually making decisions based on sound reasoning or whether it has merely learned shortcut strategies and is thus cheating.

The new CRP method draws on layer-wise relevance propagation. ""AI image recognition is a good example of this,"" says Prof. Wojciech Samek, head of the Artificial Intelligence department at Fraunhofer HHI, professor of Machine Learning and Communications at TU Berlin, and BIFOLD Fellow. ""On the input level, CRP labels which pixels within an image are most relevant for the AI decision process. This is an important step in understanding an AI's decisions, but it doesn't explain the underlying concept of why the AI considers those exact pixels.""

For comparison, when humans see a black-and-white striped surface, they don't automatically recognize a zebra. To do so, they also need information such as four legs, hooves, tail, etc. Ultimately, they combine the information of the pixels (black and white) with the concept of animal.

""CRP transfers the explanation from the input space, where the image with all its pixels is located, to the semantically enriched concept space formed by higher layers of the neural network,"" states Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin, head of the research group Explainable Artificial Intelligence at Fraunhofer HHI, elaborating on the new method.

""CRP is the next step in AI explainability and offers entirely new possibilities in terms of investigating, testing and improving the functionality of AI models. We are already very excited to apply our new method to large language models like ChatGPT.""",@naeemjohn2772,2023-10-04T17:06:09Z,0

DH50qcVaDzg,UgznBABdMFHnD90ORYt4AaABAg,"A question: Is the story breaking in today's Guardian about Tory failure to back the schools catch-up plan developed by Sir Kevan Collins being directly responsible for the North-South disparities in exam results, not a case of underfunding that should forewarn Starmer that a policy agenda based primarily on affordability criteria - and that follows current Treasury orthodoxy - should not be allowed to overtake strategic importance if further harm is to be avoided?  

If there are strategic investment priorities that are critical to making progress on the deeply undermined public infrastructure and services, then is it not unavoidable that some there must be some spending priorities that cannot be sacrificed?  Is there a political case for long term borrowing, if the alternative is more of this sort of failure down the road?  Or is Starmer merely waiting for the Tory crash pile-ups to make his argument for him?

I refer to this breaking story in the Guardian today:

Ex-schools tsar blames Tories for north-south exam divide
Sir Kevan Collins says government failure to back his ¬£15bn post-Covid catch-up plan caused the stark disparity in this year‚Äôs English GCSE results
