Dhnxer0lClw,Ugy9ha3sZkH4jqDhyYp4AaABAg,"It has long been recognised (and one of the key reasons why countries like South Korea, Germany & Japan have been so successful) that long-term fixing and ring-fencing of an optimum allocation of education budget per pupil for schools (similar to what Gordon Brown invested in when he has PM before Cameron slashed it as part of austerity measures) improves the lives and wellbeing of not only children, but the long-term prospects of the country as a whole, including economic growth, entrepreneurship, innovation, employment, business success, etc.
Not only that, it has been shown to reduce long term Government expenditure on crime, unemployment, police, courts, prisons, mental health, physical health, obesity, etc. far beyond what the investment costs.
Having an agile and fully-funded world class education system (with healthy school meals for all) is a cornerstone to a nation's long-term success !",@SumiG_Playz,2023-10-06 09:57:11+00:00,0

The question to be asked here is: why do we have to force people to do it? Why don't they want to do it? How can we motivate them? Is the system failing the students and if so, why? 
It's always the same old story: if it doesn't work, add pressure to the people.

Children at 16 who can't understand probability and statistics will struggle to make informed decisions.

While mathematical logic can't be applied to real life all the time, maths will also help with rational thinking.

Forcing all kids to do the A level maths curriculum as is won't help though. I'm sorry but no one needs to know how to differentiate and integrate functions.

DH50qcVaDzg,UgznBABdMFHnD90ORYt4AaABAg,"A question: Is the story breaking in today's Guardian about Tory failure to back the schools catch-up plan developed by Sir Kevan Collins being directly responsible for the North-South disparities in exam results, not a case of underfunding that should forewarn Starmer that a policy agenda based primarily on affordability criteria - and that follows current Treasury orthodoxy - should not be allowed to overtake strategic importance if further harm is to be avoided?  

If there are strategic investment priorities that are critical to making progress on the deeply undermined public infrastructure and services, then is it not unavoidable that some there must be some spending priorities that cannot be sacrificed?  Is there a political case for long term borrowing, if the alternative is more of this sort of failure down the road?  Or is Starmer merely waiting for the Tory crash pile-ups to make his argument for him?

I refer to this breaking story in the Guardian today:

Not only are maths-applied courses (business, computer science, engineering&tech) at least 50-60% of the top ten most studied at uk universities (with business being the top btw), maths is the most popular subject taken at A-levels. So already we find that he's full of shit but that's just scratching the surface. Boris Johnson said during the pandemic that people in certain arts related careers would have to 'retrain' to 'make a living'. Bearing in mind in 2022, the government decided to cut funds to Arts Council England Guidance of amounts going up to ¬£75 mil with another ¬£43.5 mil over the three subsequent years. This man has been (and is still trying to) scare young arts/humanities enthused pupils into believing they can't make a living and is trying to belittle arts and humanities careers in the UK. He's essentially remarking that people who study history, politics, philosophy, arts are essentially low achieving using the ""oh the economy is bad"" as nothing more than a rhetorical trick. He is a spineless, pusillanimous coward who's telling people who have passion in art/history/philosophy etc that careers in the arts and humanities are ""lazy"" and  ""unachieving"". However, he's merely scared that revisionist political movements who strive for social equality via passionate imagination/critical thought/creativity are going to destabilise his means of attaining income by trying to remove him and his friends (who want people to fear going broke by taking maths) from positions of power. This crepedarian know-nothing parasitic leach wants to keep fearing going broke through this.

So if you force 16-18 year old kids to attend extended maths training you cannot force them to actually study and they will fail regularly because they have no choice. As soon as the are 18 they will tell their teachers (if you can get any) to do one. They will also not forgive Sunak for forcing them to be bored out of their head for the extra two years and they will now be able to vote and lets hope they do and never vote Tory ever in their life.

The first is the school leaving age.  Does this poilcy mean he plans to raise it to 18?  Two more boring years for the less academically minded ""young adults"".
The second is that with the school leaving age still at 16, then those who would pursue non maths/science courses will be discouraged from doing so by the compulsory maths (oh no not more maths!).
We are of course ignoring the forbidden subject that for everyone with an IQ greater than 120, there is someone with an IQ less than 80.  Whilst I would never suggest a return to the secondary moderns and so on, it is likely that a significant portion of the population would not benefit from further acedemic education.

tH4HytdBzmM,UgwKWXaZUmK3JWJz7NN4AaABAg,"Some people are simply not good at maths. There are many possible reasons why someone might not be good at maths. Some people may have learning disabilities that make it difficult for them to understand mathematical concepts. Others may have had negative experiences with math in the past, which have caused them to develop a fear or anxiety around the subject. Still others may simply have a natural lack of aptitude for math. Lack of aptitude is important. I was not great at maths in school. I got my GCSE and gave up on the subject. Others may not even achieve a good GCSE result, so why force them to study something which they are probably going to fail at? This sets up a wave of demoralised students. This may cause them to cease their studies due to frustration. This cannot be good. Also, if you are going to force people to study subjects rooted in logic, why not add coding to the mix? Surely that is a good 21st century skill.
As far as 21st century skills are concerned, why not teach Critical Thinking? 

 Critical thinking is a mental process that involves carefully evaluating information and considering options before making a decision. It involves the ability to think logically and objectively, and to analyze and evaluate arguments and evidence in order to reach a well-reasoned conclusion. It is an essential skill that can be applied to many different areas of life, including problem-solving, decision-making, and evaluating information. Critical thinking requires an open mind and the willingness to consider multiple perspectives on an issue, as well as the ability to identify biases and assumptions that may affect one's thinking. It is an important skill to develop as it can help you to become a more effective and rational thinker, and to make better decisions in your personal and professional life.

I suppose that if this was taught, no-one would ever vote Conservative!


Additionally, a lack of access to quality maths education can also contribute to someone's difficulty with the subject. This is a salient point, where are they going to get the additional maths teachers from? Education already struggles with recruitment and retention of teachers. 

It's important to note that anyone can improve their maths skills with effort and practice, and that there are many resources available to help people learn math at their own pace. So if you want to improve your maths skills, get a tutor, even watch YouTube videos or buy a course on Udemy or another learning platform. There are some high-quality resources available these days.

The Government should consider redesigning the education system so it is fit for purpose in the 21st Century. My background is in second language teaching. The existing system of studying grammar and vocabulary, reading texts, listening to audio and writing essays or reports simply does not work. The purpose of a language is to allow communication. In order to communicate, we speak. Yet language classes have little or no focus on the oral production of language. Students learn about things like modal verbs, defining and non-defining relative clauses and so on, but they don‚Äôt learn how to speak. I used the preposition ‚Äúabout‚Äù deliberately because in our system, the students learn about language. We do not produce effective communicators.",@andrewmacdonald1103,2023-01-08 23:28:03+00:00,0

With regard to mathematics, I can quite understand the presenter's emphasis on practical numeracy - fair enough. Bit why not try and deliver the intrinsic interest of the subject as well? People read poetry and novels or watch plays for enjoyment and general enrichment (and that's supposedly at least why these things are taught at school), but hardly ever do I hear of the same being done with  mathematics. 

Mathematics is about patterns and the patterns behind patterns. Who can fail to be moved by the Mandelbrot Set, the weird Koch Curve, the sheer elegance of conic sections when visualised (as well as their use in engineering and physics). Or even the patterns in the boring multiplication tables grid. Not just 9, 18, 27, 36... (falling units, rising tens...) but the 8x (cycles endings in 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8...). Then ask the class what the 7's do. Les obvious, but there is still an elegant pattern to the final digits - (0)**, 7, 4, 1, 8,5,2, 9,6,3,0,7, 4, 1... i.e. 0 starts the new cycle. Maybe here you could use Cuisenaire rods to help. Might help memorisation, too. In fact the final digits in any base (e.g. 12, 13, hexadecimal, 64...) are an application of arithmetic modulo that base. (Think it out - e.g. look up 'modulo', 'clock arithmetic' and counting bases other than 10 online and see if you can draw similar conclusions!). I'm aware this latter is flies a bit high for primary classrooms. Note however that a lot of code-breaking from Bletchley Park to the present day relies on finding patterns in numbers and statistics. One enterprising maths teacher teamed up with her opposite number in the history department and had her Year 8 class transported back to Bletchley Park during WW2. She then devised messages for the learners to decode using methods appropriate to their abilities. I hope the Ukrainians have something like Bletchley Park now.

I could go on to considerable length but I hope this gives a glimpse of mathematics being interesting for its own sake - although it's also extremely useful in all areas of life from figuring out recipes and the weekly housekeeping budget to spotting Government and corporate bullsh*t - and in understanding all engineering design. And I've found that my  'useful' maths has been greatly enhanced by finding it fascinating. Not every learner will react like me, but if intrinsic interest rather than test results could be pushed a bit harder then at least learners would see the subject for what it really is. 

I strongly recommend 'A Mathematician's Lament' by Dr Paul Lockhart, available online and as a book. He's a PhD who went back to the classroom and his conclusions on mathematics teaching would make the present lot of charlatans, slick biz-persons and con-artists very uncomfortable even though written up ten or twelve years ago! I think a lot of the teaching profession do their best (e.g. maths clubs, intelligent use of online videos and paperwork), but the system is against them.

Finally. I was talking recently at a reunion to a distinguished Old Boy of my school who'd been taught maths in the private sector in the Golden Age of the 1950s (all bow, all scrape!). Unfortunately his 'teacher's method of ensuring retention was sometimes picking on students who hadn't grasped it and sometimes I think liberal use of a blackboard rubber or similar as a missile. Result - gentleman hated and feared mathematics. Then came the twist - he said he often saw patterns in scenes and objects round about him, more or less subconsciously... AARGGHH! Because that's what real mathematics is about!

5. Distraction/deflection = change the subject to draw off accountability. For example, ""we need more maths""....
Purpose = control, domination, takes pleasure in the suffering of the vulnerable... (sadistic)
BTW, this is orthodox, robust, and rigorously defined and checked. It is in every psychology textbook. What are the implications of these personality styles on the population?

How would you like it, for example, if your dentist had a degree in science but no dentistry qualification? Or the person teaching your child maths whose degree was in Biology? This decline in professional standards is euphemistically called ""the staffing-led curriculum"" which, briefly put, means that anyone on the school's staff who, say, had some timetable slack and once did piano to Grade 6 as a child but whose degree was in History could be dragooned into teaching Music. This, in turn, is further exacerbated  by the government doing away with Qualified Teacher status, which opens the door to any Tom, Dick or Harry. The teaching profession is hard-working, committed and conscientious but treated with contempt by the current government. My own degree was in Modern Languages  - specifically, French and German  - but in my 37 years of teaching  (I'm retired, thankfully), I have ""taught"" Music, Latin, Russian, English and RE for various periods of time. My input must have been much less than that of specialist teachers and I hope it didn‚Äôt disadvantage the students. The situation is unacceptable but that old Blairite mantra ""Education,  Education, Education"" is still valid but, alas, given mere lip service by the current government. Look, if it's not too depressing or painful, at the Tories' appointments to the key post of Secretary of State for Education in recent memory and especially that of that spectacularly stupid, incompetent and ignorant former fireplace salesman whose staggering cockups were rewarded with a knighthood. A work of fiction would be hard pressed to equal this for credibility.

tH4HytdBzmM,UgyztynueTz_aT-Fanp4AaABAg,"There is a considerable shortage of teachers - especially maths teachers - in England and Wales. Teachers in both Primary and Seconday schools have to cope with large class sizes and a huge work-load, and are always having to get children to pass various tests (SATS) rather than being free to teach the underlying *principles* involved. Teaching in state schools in the UK is a high-stress job, and the pay is far from ideal - hence the shortage of teachers. 

So along with the valid points about the type of maths taught, and to what level, the problem of capacity is by far the greatest. Hence this government policy will never happen under a Tory government. 

Of course, independent schools (unhelpfully known as Publid Schools) are mostly far better funded, have good quality teachers, teaching small class sizes, with good resources for subjects such as science and music - unlike state schools, which are run on a shoestring, and which are all struggling to be able to pay for the teachers and teaching hours which the law demands that they do. 

And as long as there are well-funded independent schools for the rich elite to send their children, the Tories have ZERO interest in properly funding state education. They see this as pandering to the 'plebs.' The Tory mindset is that all the little brats of the lower orders need to do is to have minimal education - indeed, if the Tories could get away with sending children to work up chimneys or down mines, that would be just fine.

1. Continuity, i had a maths teacher from i think to year 8 to year 10 who was brilliant, then in year 11 he left and was replaced by a brand new teacher who was a nice guy but because he was new he was hated by most of the students so he spent most of his lessons trying to calm the class down.
2. Money, my school was fairly underfunded. i was diagnosed with a learning disability during primary school and when i went to high my parents sent the notes and diagnosis to the school and they kept on messing up, i remember when i had to do something arty and i couldn't do it because i can't really write with this learning Disability, so my teacher just kept on forcing me to do it until i literally shouted at her that i couldn't do it (Which was weird because I'm normally very quite in a class) 
Another issue was when i was doing geography which is something i really like during the first year in GCSE they just transferred me from Geography to Prince's trust because they thought ""It would be easier"" Despite princes trust being a very sociable thing it sounded like hell for me. but the issue was when i shouted this at her and my parents were properly annoyed at them i now realise that they probably had no idea what we were talking about, which indicates that no training for students with learning disabilities was given to them",@connoredwards7000,2023-01-08 17:25:11+00:00,8

The ree.phasis on Maths requires far more educated, intelligent and we'll paid teachers Given the declining IQ of teachers and there much lower pay rates, doubling teacher salaries is probably required to attraxt 120 IQ top ten percent students s rather than the current 107-110 IQ teachers merely from the top third or quarter in most comprehensives.Paying for the new policy will not be achieved purely by economic growth less will have to be spent in the next decade on health, pharmaceuticals, social work, social medicine, psychiatry, law and orde and areas of public transport.Some of these fields may be abolished and higher calibre forces in say policing and social work may seen a halving of staff.",@frederickmiles327,2023-04-17 11:47:43+00:00,2

zDsVLGRHdCI,UgytvPvfMz3YGWYyrVd4AaABAg,"There still seems to be people who think that 'A-levels' have not been dumbed down. In the case of mathematics the evidence for this is overwhelming so I think it's worth demonstrating that.

It is common practice at many universities to give the same standard maths test to all engineering, physics and maths students when they first arrive in order to discover any gaps in their knowledge so that first year maths courses can be adjusted to fill in any weak areas. Knowing the students A-level result in Maths and using the test result gives the following:

For a 1991 cohort at Coventry University, the scores of those who got N (a fail) in A-level maths in 1991, (some soft sciences were open to those who failed A-level maths), were virtually identical to those who got a grade C in 1997. And the continuation of the same study revealed that 1991 N-graders were equivalent to 1999 B-graders. In general, then, on certain basic mathematical skills, A-level standards in maths are dropping one grade every two years. And in a diagnostic test given at York University over 15 years, and reported separately in 2001, this finding is corroborated. A student with an A grade at A-level now had a score on the test which would have put him or her near the bottom of the cohort in 1986, and, even more striking perhaps, an average grade B student at A-level was able to score only marginally better on the York test than could have been done by random guessing.

From the university of Sussex: 
Students skills have gradually declined over the years. As the test has been used since the 1970s (with some small changes during the 1980s due to A-Level curriculum changes), some statistical data is available to indicate this. A two page memorandum was circulated inside the department in 1998.
This memorandum indicated that the mean of correct responses (out of 30 questions) fell from 25 to 18.5 between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s.

""Algebraic skills amongst math A level students have declined to such an extent that the manipulation of powers and logarithms is a dark mystery to many"" (we used to call it O-level Maths in my day).

See for example ""Historical Study of Correlation between  A-Level Grades and Subsequent Performance Ken Todd  University of York"". The study in that case runs from 1985 to 2001, but since pass rates have continued to increase since 2001 I don't believe things are any different.

One university (I forget which one) had to abandon its test in 2000 as too difficult. None of this is recent. Standards have continued to decline and all universities have now had to abandon their standard maths test for STEM students and concentrate on teaching remedial classes to bring students up to the old A-level standard.",@Zantorc,2023-04-17 19:33:34+00:00,1

1.  First write sth in prose , like suppose .... That should exert mind of the learner very little. Like an aero plane start moving on the runway. 

This is what an ingenous teacher do at the start of the lecture. 

2.  Little-by-little give small challenges to the learner. For this purpose, give more than enough time to the learner. Show your pleasure when he succeeds. Continue likewise aero plane's runway movement in teaching. 

3.  Escape aero plane's mid air movement until the final result is obtained.

Building intuition and understanding the topic and fundamentals like you focus on here is key, but only takes you so far, in a way, and to actually be able to solve many different (varying) problems you need to put all that understanding into practice and solve many different problems.

A simple and elegant solution is to draw the 2 diagonals - where they meet is the right place. What if the window has 4 equal parts? Simply repeat the process on each half.
Now, 60 years later, I happened to think: ""What if the window has 3 equal parts?"" And using some creativity I solved it. Try it! You have probably never seen any formula or algorithm for this, so you must think creatively!

I struggle with maths and science subjects generally (probably because of the gap year I took after secondary school).

The long time it takes for me to understand per study session, and the fact that I only end up really internalising a little highly demotivate me to study. But because I like screen time, I'm trying to use it for good by trying study apps. But I haven't found any good ones!

pByDJDUEbUA,UgzLnk6r3sztf8pT9Ch4AaABAg,"There are three parts too good math I reckon. Firstly, knowing that every symbol in math is a mix of plus, minus, add and divide. Secondly, knowing that algebra is the rules of mathematics, and you cannot do the formulas without knowing algebra. And thirdly is the concept, having someone explain it to you so you understand the nature of the problem, so that you can visualize it in the mind; As in this video. If you have a failure in the first two, then the problem is likely the student. And if you have a failure of the third, then the problem is likely the teacher. This is the way I see it.

The problem for the student is most likely, to call out the teacher, they need a good knowledge base from the first two. But if you explain all three to a student, I reckon they should be able to skip the teacher, and discover these things on their own. There should be enough resources out there these days. They just need to swallow a bit of pride, especially if their problem is the first problem I mentioned.

So, I agree with concept in this video. But I would not call them hacks. Calling them hacks I reckon likely makes the student fell hopeless. I would call them being taught to visualize.",@MozartificeR,2023-10-31 05:34:05+00:00,0

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxlcLOLwxkDea61EdV4AaABAg,"Here's how I approached the problem:
Let the side of the red square= a and blue square= b 
To find: (a^2)/(b^2).
Now to reduce the variables in the equation I let a = 1 as no specific value is given, (even if you let a to be something else, since we are finding ratios here, it'll always reduce to the simplest form. )
now we need to find 1/(b^2).
Notice that the circle has its diameter equal to the hypotenuse of the red square. 
=> using the Pythagoras theorem we have diameter = ‚àö(1^2+1^2) = ‚àö2. 
Diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the blue square. Therefore we have, b =‚àö2 and b^2 = 2. Hence 1/(b^2) = 1/2 .",@biscuit_6081,2023-10-13 06:35:40+00:00,11

I'm cursed to always make a problem more complicated than it is, no matter how easy it is.

For example, today in an exam I had to represent a simple 4d vector by a linear combination of two vectors, with one vector as element of a given 2d subvector space and the other vector element of its complement. I started to create this linear system of equations with 4 equations and 4 variables to end up at the wrong result, no matter how many times I tried, wasting 15 minutes with it.

pByDJDUEbUA,UgzRinJ0Fem82RBdr3d4AaABAg,"This problem was quite easy, I will explain my approach for anyone interested. I started out by simply labeling the inner side length a, and the outer side length c, and used the Pythagorean theorem to get c^2 in terms of a^2 (c^2 = a^2 / 2). The ratio of the areas is simply c^2 / a^2, so using what we just found this gives us (a^2 / 2) / a^2, and the a^2 here cancel leaving us with 1/2.

The problem, just like many others, becomes elementary when you apply tools such as Pythagoras and geometric relationships. You simply have to learn intuitively when to use each tool.

i also suggest deriving trigonometric and calculas formulas to understand their origin and retain them better also dig a bit deeper to understand why we made such topic , example: calculas was develped to calculate what speed , velocities or any other sort of motion on an instant such as calculating the speed at 0.000000001 sec , we tend to take limit tends to zero for this ,which implies that time is approaching 0 but cannot be exact zero itself . maths is a language trust me , the more you speak it (practice it ) the more u get it .. but the practice must be mindful .",@abundantsoul6487,2023-10-04 04:54:55+00:00,8

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxGCiDPowOBcpLMyjh4AaABAg,"There is someone who will never EVER leave your side, and His name is Jesus Christ! 2000+ years ago he came to earth and suffered beatings, being abandoned by His closest friends, being betrayed unto death, being spat on, and nailed to a cross. Why did He endure all of this? Well, it doesn't quite make sense until you look at yourself. God has his moral Law, the Ten Commandments, and you and I have broken God's Law. The Ten Commandments require us not to lie, steal, use God's name in vain (blasphemy), commit adultery (Which Jesus says looking at others with lust is the same as adultery), and murdering (which Jesus also says hating someone is the same as being a murderer at heart). These are only a few of the commandments, and breaking just one makes you guilty of breaking them all (James 2:10). so, have you lied before? or stolen? hated someone, looked with lust, or used God's name in vain (ex: saying ""oh my ***). If so, God seeing you as a lying, thieving, blaspheming, adulterous murderer at heart. You are guilty before God of eternal death in Hell (the Bible says the wages of sin is death in Romans 6:23). And this should terrify you, for the Bible says in Hell there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and that it is like a lake of fire that is never quenched. There will be no laughing, no partying, just eternal suffering. But back to Jesus. When He came to earth and suffered and died on that cross, though He never needed to die since He was sinless, He was paying the debt of your sins as well as mine. Then, He rose from the dead, thus conquering death and proving that all who believe on Him will likewise rise from death to life. 
So, i imploreeee you, homie, put your trust is Jesus Christ TODAY, and God will grant you ever lasting life. The rest of Romans 6:23 says ""The wages of sin is death, but the FREE GIFT OF GOD is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" So, trust in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Believe on Him and you will be saved.",@skyesinlovewithChrist,2023-10-02 00:34:22+00:00,1

Amyyyy congratulations 


4:08 omggg thank you for mentioning me


Absolutely love the construction example, it's important to have more information rather than having more tools! Like if you know how to revise youll revise in an hour but if you dont know how to revise and you stare at the book for even hours you wont understand anything. 

Oh yes, some math teachers just tell you revise the formula but the truth is even if you know all the formulas but don't know where to use them, they are useless 

One of the tips i really liked was that, instead of thinking you dont know the question, apply what you already know. Amyy we started a new chapter and i was having difficulty identifying so i divided the questions into 2 parts and solved it although it was long i was able to solve it and that motivated me to try other questions as well!
And solving questions similar to the previous question even if you understood the concept is very important because before exam, while going through the notes we all think we know but many times when we see the paper we forget the concept.

It so so important to identify if you understand the concept or not, its easy to just memorise but it's hard to understand. Its better to understand the concept because once you UNDERSTAND everything becomes easy.

Amyyy thank you so much for this amazing video, you are helping soo soo many people with your knowledge. Stay happy and congratulations on 39.5k it's amazing to see how far youve come, you truly deserve this and so much more!

pByDJDUEbUA,UgxCrjQt1rIpWDg-_lV4AaABAg,"Veil's Summary Notes:

This is How To ACE Math Step-By-Step.

- It's not about how many formulas you know. Instead, it's all about your problem solving skills and math sense.

But let's start with problem solving.

- Problem = Anything that humans pretend to have a missing piece of information to.
- Solution = That 'missing' piece of information which was never missing to begin with. 
- So To solve a problem, all you have to do is express the connections of this missing piece of information that isn't really missing, but always existed within the problem's context, yet people pretend it is missing just for the sake of challenging our mental capabilities.

Getting back to math sense, don't just learn excessive amounts of formulas without understanding HOW to use them in the first place. That's where your math sense comes in. 

Note: Math Sense = Math Skills.

The greater your Math Sense, the less you need to memorize.

Your Math Sense is basically the Cheat skill that will help you solve ANY Problem that comes your way in Math.

This is HOW You Acquire it;


1. Prioritize Understanding Over Memorizing.

For example, for the square root of 25, don't worry about memorizing the fact that; ""the square root of 25 is 5.""

Instead, focus on understanding the actual step by step process you need to take, to find the ""square root"" of something.

In other words, focus on understanding the meanings of each symbols and terms, especially the steps they require you to take.

Once you do understand these MAiN symbols/figures and what steps they require you to take, then you can do practice problems with ease.

You don't need to use any advanced memorization techniques once you understand, because when you do practice problems or your homeworks and assignments, then these operations will become engraved in your memory, whether you like it or not!


2. Break Your Math Problem into Parts.

Usually, we don't understand the foundations behind bigger math problems, that's why we tend to get stuck. Therefore, doing this will help spot our gaps in knowledge.

We know when we lack a certain knowledge when we look at the individual parts within the problem, and go, ""huh?""

If you don't understand some parts within that problem, then break those parts down even further untill you spot familiar concepts you can use to build on your understanding.

If you break down the parts within a problem, but still don't understand those parts, then KEEP Breaking Those Parts Down Further! Keep breaking them down to something sooo basic, that it is impossible for you to NOT understand it.


3. Review Fundamentals on a Deeper Level.

After you've understood the fundamentals of each parts within the problem on the previous step, now is the time to solidify those concepts!

Watch some extra videos or do some extra research to clarify why the steps work, as well as their origins.

This will deepen your understanding.

You can also do practice problems to test, strengthen, and gain feedback for your understanding. Either use materials provided by your teachers or find free resources online.

Note that these are fundamental problems and NOT similar to the original problem you were dealing with. These little problems are to help you gain an basic understanding inorder to add to the original problem you were working on. For example, you'll work on 1+1=2 as your fundamental problems before moving to your original problem, which could be something like 12+13=25.

Repeat this step as much as you feel like it. Your internal feeling of certainty will be your guide.


4. Put The Pieces Together, and Then Reference The Solution.

Basically, try solving the original question yourself, as well as others similar to it once you've nailed the fundamental practice problems. 

Do this without looking at the answer key.

If you get to a part and feel stuck, you still must NOT look at the answer key... Yet.

Because the mental strain you feel is How your brain forces itself to access the recent understandings you've just created during the first few steps leading up to here.

Staying in this state of discomfort whilst forcing yourself to figure it out (even if your answer key is right on the next page) will pay dividends later toward your Math Sense.

Only after a long while (over 20 minutes of being stuck on the same step) do you check the answe key. But before that, try do the following within your 20 minutes;

A) Write down everything you know that could be relevant.
B) Draw connections between what you know. You can use arrows or lines to show these.
C) Make your best attempt, showcasing the full thought process you have regarding the potential solution. Give your best guess here.

After doing these 3 do you check the answer key. You can then compare the provided solutions against your own, and  see how similar or different they are.

This is where the problem-solving skills get built, and your Math Sense as well.

Lastly, Math is NOT Memorizing. 
Knowing HOW Math Works will make you the master of your math class, and NOT the victim of difficult equations.

by Martina M√ºller , Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft
 New method for explainable AI
CRP method. Credit: Fraunhofer HHI

Artificial intelligence is already in widespread use, yet it is still difficult to understand how an AI system reaches its decisions. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) at TU Berlin have collaborated for many years to make AI explainable. Now the scientists led by Prof. Thomas Wiegand (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD), Prof. Wojciech Samek (Fraunhofer HHI, BIFOLD) and Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin (Fraunhofer HHI) have achieved another milestone.

In their paper ""From attribution maps to human-understandable explanations through concept relevance propagation,"" the researchers present concept relevance propagation (CRP), a new method that can explain individual AI decisions as concepts understandable to humans. The paper has now been published in Nature Machine Intelligence.

AI systems are largely black boxes: It is usually not comprehensible to humans how an AI arrives at a certain decision. CRP is a state-of-the-art explanatory method for deep neural networks that complements and deepens existing explanatory models. In doing so, CRP reveals not only the characteristics of the input that are relevant to the decision made, but also the concepts the AI used, the location where they are represented in the input, and which parts of the neural network are responsible for them.

Thus, CRP is able to explain individual decisions made by an AI using concepts that are understandable to humans. As a result, this research sets an entirely new standard for the evaluation of and interaction with AI.

For the first time, this approach to explainability takes a look at the entire prediction process of an AI‚Äîall the way from input to output. In recent years, the research team has already developed various methods for using so-called heat maps to explain how AI algorithms reach their decisions.

The heat maps highlight specific areas in an image that are particularly relevant to the decision made. This method has become known as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). The importance of this type of explainability is enormous, as it allows us to understand whether an AI is actually making decisions based on sound reasoning or whether it has merely learned shortcut strategies and is thus cheating.

The new CRP method draws on layer-wise relevance propagation. ""AI image recognition is a good example of this,"" says Prof. Wojciech Samek, head of the Artificial Intelligence department at Fraunhofer HHI, professor of Machine Learning and Communications at TU Berlin, and BIFOLD Fellow. ""On the input level, CRP labels which pixels within an image are most relevant for the AI decision process. This is an important step in understanding an AI's decisions, but it doesn't explain the underlying concept of why the AI considers those exact pixels.""

For comparison, when humans see a black-and-white striped surface, they don't automatically recognize a zebra. To do so, they also need information such as four legs, hooves, tail, etc. Ultimately, they combine the information of the pixels (black and white) with the concept of animal.

""CRP transfers the explanation from the input space, where the image with all its pixels is located, to the semantically enriched concept space formed by higher layers of the neural network,"" states Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin, head of the research group Explainable Artificial Intelligence at Fraunhofer HHI, elaborating on the new method.

""CRP is the next step in AI explainability and offers entirely new possibilities in terms of investigating, testing and improving the functionality of AI models. We are already very excited to apply our new method to large language models like ChatGPT.""",@naeemjohn2772,2023-10-04 17:06:09+00:00,0

I began to admire mathematics when I ""forced"" myself to be interested in it. In doing so I actually came to realise the importance of the field and how it can be applied to almost anything (especially in this digital era) in the real world.

I would argue STEM including maths, obviously has been seen as so vital anything else has been totally forgotten about. It's also debatable what exactly is important and what isn't. In terms of income the creative industries are huge- while the engineering and maths helps build the computer the interface, design (vision) is what people are inspired by.

It is like teaching philology to children whose reading skills are poor, it confuses them and pulls up the shutters.

I believe that mathematicians are not best placed to set the maths curriculum. Not that elegant maths should not be taught but it should be introduced at a time when children are receptive and not earlier.
One of the year nines I tutored yesterday said something interesting in that while we do the topics she understands then but during maths tests she has no idea of what they are asking. It doesn't help that at the end of KS3 her skills are not even KS2.

Day to day there actually isn‚Äôt much use for understanding higher level maths concepts, however they‚Äôre crucial and lay the foundation for many jobs based in engineering, programming, finance, data analysis, etc. Any student hoping to peruse a career in any of those subjects MUST have a strong understanding of high level fundamental maths concepts, however the majority of the population, simply won‚Äôt have any use for them, so by instead focusing on practical applications that‚Äôre often used day to day, students will likely be more engaged, or at least have a better appreciation for the utility of the subject, and more importantly, be able to aptly apply mathematical skills when needed.

 I think there also needs to be a fundamental change in our process of teaching mathematics. Maths cannot be taught like history or biology, there needs to be a much bigger focus on understanding proofs, logic, and derivations. With our current curriculum students aren‚Äôt pushed to understand maths concepts, only use them, and far too little time goes into explaining why it works. It seems some educators believe that trying to explain the derivation of formulas would only confuse students, particularly those struggling already, but I reckon the reason they‚Äôre struggling is because they haven‚Äôt been shown why it works in the first place! the UKMT does a great job of this, their challenges are full of much more practical questions with a much stronger reliance on simple logic rather than abstract mathematical concepts, actually displaying the power of rational thinking and some basic algebra, geometry, and numeracy skills and how it can solve day to day problems.

That being said, I also really loved the idea of creating two different subjects - Functional Maths and 'Academic' Maths - in line with the English Literature and English Language subjects which we currently have in schools.

Perhaps they could be named slightly differently, such as 'Practical Mathematics' and 'Creative Mathematics', to interest students more and prevent a class bias? And, just as with English Language and English Literature, both routes should be taught to all children (as Professor Coles notes) to ensure that those in worse-off areas are not left behind.

I think a lot of students find maths very difficult because they don't have super solid understanding of the stuff previously learnt, and so new stuff is even harder to pick up.

I recently worked in a state school in a very poor area, and it was clear to me that even though their living situations had forced them to grow up much faster in some ways (lots of young carers, kids looking after younger children, having to deal with knife crime and gangs), they had a very naiive and childlike understanding of school. 

Many of them seemed to only come to the realization that their GCSEs determined their futures in the last few months before the exams. They'd beg for help in a panic when they were already years behind where they should have been and it was very depressing how hopeless they ended up.

The breadth of content in GCSEs has increased so much since I did my own, it was no surprise that struggling children couldn't keep up.

P2UpenE_oWM,UgwzckS8S4qkO1bKbI94AaABAg,"I have to say the vast swathes of this documentary does little to clearly explore the issues of the education structures.

For instance, using numeracy to describe functional maths skills is misleading,as it implies a mastery of the 4 basic functions to be the necessary aspect of mathematics, but also throws in concepts like decimals and percentages which are abstractions of shape and space concepts, not just numeracy concepts.

The notion of functional maths is inherently flawed as a means of solution, because it attempts to detach the linear progression of mathematical structures, in an arbitrary manner, without forethought as to what functional skills would look like- which the Bristol Professor helpfully highlights is Statistics- in the future.

This amounts to a documentary focused on fixing  a historic issue, which will inevitably rear its head again, if this focus on 'functional maths' occupies the discussion of the divide in ability experienced across the UK.

The Lord touting his lack of understanding for the utility of quadratics is another example of this, since it demonstrates that people cannot see the function of the tools they have, because the structures of education cannot 'waste' time providing it.

Ultimately, there are greater issues in education, let alone mathematics, than simply 'how do we reduce the friction of abstract thinking broadly'.
There are problems in the transition from primary to secondary, teachers have a limited understanding of where students are at, so result in a slow down in years 7/8, as content is repeated.
Trainee teachers have a high variance of success; based upon mentor figure; drastically changing their ability to enter the teaching market.
Teacher training schemes have grossly variant requirements, even when trainee's are performing the same role.

Moving back to Maths focused issues, it is a uniquely isolated subject from all others at school, largely due to other disciplines failing to appropriately utilise the language of maths within their field, in part due to historic maths anti-bias.

I could rant forever about the issues I've seen, but suffice to say; this documentary broadly fails to demonstrate the relatability of maths as a language, because the presenter does not know how to do that, so their exploration of the topic at best repeats the mistakes of the past, at worse causes exacerbated anxiety in parents who cannot parse the more immediate issues preventing their children's success.

This is both a macro and a micro problem, but like the topics in maths, the links between those issues are broadly missing in this piece.

I have met others like me who can't do maths, one of the reasons being a feeling of loathing. I get irritated when I hear about maths anxiety: maths phobia is closer to the truth and it's the word used for instance ein France (my country).

1) the people who offer these solutions are good at maths and (probaly) enjoy the subject. How can they understand, if they've never felt the horror?
2) they all suggest different recipes. So which one if the right one? 
3) if there really was a way of overcoming maths phobia, then problem would have disappeared long ago. Instead of which we have a number of people for whom one or another of the recipes might work...

When they got it on their own (admittedly after a while), it was amazing to see how those kids became more confident and lit up. Often, there is just not enough time for those kids and they just get left behind. As a result they just disengage and stop trying to learn because they can't keep up. 

I remembered this because now that I'm studying maths at uni, I have really underestimated the power of reading and comprehension, especially for tricky maths questions (that are now put into real life contexts) and I just think that our foundations in reading and learning how to learn are  just too weak.

P2UpenE_oWM,UgzQQJKR4pUc5An8jeh4AaABAg,"As a 16 year old, although it was a while ago, I do not remember properly learning anything to do with maths in primary school except times tables and brushing on algebra (which now in a levels they would expect you to be able to learn in 1 lesson plus a bit of time outside of school, not 6 years.) In my opinion it is a missed opportunity that we do not use that time more productively. Also, I did quite badly in maths for the 11+ and got halfway between a 8 and a 9 in maths without completely working my socks off. That stopped me from going to the grammar school which I just now recently went to. It just goes to show imo how taking a test at an age when kids don't really care about tests or where kids without tutors are at at a disadvantage doesn't always create the best situation.

I excelled in English and the humanities, even in the sciences I was a high performer. In the Maths classroom, however, I found myself in an environment that was impatient, hostile, and humiliating. My teachers never made an effort to make the lessons interesting, but they would always make an effort to humiliate me whenever they had the chance to do so. You weren't listening for a moment? Get out the class. You get a question wrong? Get out the class. There was one teacher who i had for Maths who i hated and who hated me, and he made my life in that classroom a living hell (he would later turn out to be a pedophile, which was an unpleasant revelation). Years after that experience i went through life under the assumption that i had no maths aptitude, all because some shitty teachers convinced me that i had no ability in the subject. In contrast, my Humanities and English teachers were always very nice, patient, and encouraging. I don't think it's a coincidence that i excelled in the classes that were positively reinforcing and patient. I think that, were maths classes more patient, encouraging, and inclusive of different minds, instead of prone to making an example of the outliers, then more people wouldn't be afraid of it",@nobodyofimportance3922,2023-10-09 14:34:53+00:00,186

Then in my 3rd year I got a new maths teacher who was very enthusiastic not only about maths but about seeing to it that we students were actually taking the information on board and understand things fully. I slowly began to unlearn my hatred for maths and actually quite enjoyed it. Sadly I had to leave school with almost no attendence in my 4th year due to health complications and ever since I've been wishing that like many of my other subjects I could've kept going. Thankfully Khan Academy has helped me brush up on a lot of the subjects of maths that I was still not very good at and I hope to continue learning. at the age of 13 I never would've thought that I would be willfully studying mathematics in my own time for my own enjoyment...

2) Personal health and well being
3) Career exploration
4) Personal finance
5) Workplace laws & safety

7) How to tackle important life milestones (e.g., passport applications, driver's licenses, social security numbers, getting hired, accessing legal aid, changimg a flat tire, renting an apartment, etc.)

Maths is Not difficult, it is just the lack of parental input at home to back up, support, what is attempted to be taught in schools.
Additionally Cursive Handwriting was CEASED at the same time in the early 1980s. Give anyone under age 50 something, anything, written in Cursive Script and they will look at it and hand it back... cant read it. 
All of this because a Vocal Minority had Cursive handwriting and Times Tables by Rote cut - in the Thatcher era = she was more than pleased with herself to spend a few pennies per child across the UK. 
What she and the NIMBY parents did not comprehend... ALL Shops have to have tills that READ the bank notes and calculate and give the change - mechanically. Go to a shop and buy something ¬£6.72 and give the person at the till ¬£12.22 and see the look you will get and the... YOU game me TOO much money... What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? 
You have to tell them, can you count how much I gave you? Enter that amount in the till... and how much change does it give. (Change ¬£5.50)
HOW did it do that? Tell me? How did it do that?? 
My parents taught me to Read and Count to 100 before age 4 and by my fourth birthday, I was taught basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Illiterate and innumerate parents can not teach children how to do things they can not do.

That some or a lot of people can have what's called Dyscalculia, which is Dyslexia's lesser-known sibling.

Dyscalculia (Mathematics) - Dyslexia (Reading & Writing)

Dyscalculia symptoms can include but are not limited to.

Typical symptoms include:


*Difficulty counting backwards.

*Difficulty remembering 'basic' facts.

*Slow to perform calculations.

*Weak mental arithmetic skills.

*A poor sense of numbers & estimation.

* Difficulty in understanding place value.

*Addition is often the default operation.

*High levels of mathematics anxiety.

This can or could be a neurological condition in the brain that again, can or could be the culprit and as to why certain people struggle with mathematics as a whole, not just the basics.

Also, Asians have spawned from trading and bartering social systems and have cultures for millennia that differ from others around the world.

Modern school is about learning concepts and formulas, and being able to cram enough info in hopes you have to repeat some of it on the pages of an exam. None of it is about understanding the concepts, and why they're important.
Only reason I care about, and understand pythagorus is because of a videogame I play. Only reason I understand some algebra and Ohms law is because of odd bits and bobs I built.
Kids need a reason to care beyond 'because I said so'.
And the mention that kids in other countries play numbers games and we don't is on point. Even a basic game like marbles can teach kids about angles, which can go on to teach about refraction,. Or games like conkers can teach about addition whereby if one conker moves and another stays still the impact will be at x m/s, but if both move it will be at x*2 m/s.

Panic and stress should be addressed by the people who are actually trained for that (not me), and not by lowering the bar at the expense of the average student.

Unless you are really talented, mathematics is going to be hard work for you. No amount of good teaching practices can change this. So maybe we are becoming less used to put in the hard work?

There is an irony in Lord Baker saying that the system needs replacing. When he oversaw its introduction, the majority of teachers saw that it was flawed. It also annoys me that comparison is made with Asian countries. They are taught by rote. Individual thinking is discouraged. I've taught students from Korea, Japan, and China, whose parents were here for post-graduate courses. They had memorised whole text books, but I'm fairly sure that few of them would have coped with a question set in a different way. Probably the greatest strength of teaching in England is a willingness to think outside the box, to be imaginative, and to question what they have been taught.

I was a teacher for 35 years, though not a maths teacher. However, I often used to cover for absent maths teachers. I used to get annoyed with the students at first, always asking for help, being unwilling to take their own decisions.

One day, a thought struck me. I noticed, during a lesson with a lower set, where they were supposed to be answering questions on fractions, that the majority of the class simply could not visualise fractions. I decided to abandon the work set, and despite not being a maths teacher, I handed out some paper and scissors, which we then used to create concrete fractions. I was shocked that the class responded so well. They began doing calculations similar to the ones that they had seen in the textbook. They soon became enthusiastic to start the questions that they had been set, and I persuaded them to complete them all at home.

A couple of days later, the class teacher came to ask me about the lesson as she did not understand why the whole class had achieved 90% or more on the work. She thought that I must have given them the answers. I didn't mind her thinking that we had cheated, but I was annoyed when she was surprised at the truth. 

It has to be said that part of the trouble with a lot of maths teachers is their complete inability to understand that not everyone is as numerate as they are themselves. They often make assumptions that everyone enjoys maths the same way that they do. As an outsider in the maths classroom, even though I am numerate, it was obvious to me that there was something wrong, not with the students, but with the way they were expected to do work that appears simple, but is difficult for them. I realised why, as they left the room, several of the class asked if I could be their maths teacher. After this experience, I never held back, but if they struggled I would take the set work down to something that they understood. As the video said, a huge problem is that students experience failure too much. I gave them a tiny success that made them feel that they were not stupid",@PLuMUK54,2023-10-01 19:58:07+00:00,5

For generations math has been held up as this nebulous difficult subject that only a select few who ‚Äòget it‚Äô can enter.

All their lives they have been told that math is beyond them, so I have to spend a lot of time peeling away those biases so that they have a chance to succeed. These biases persist because most people will never use anything more than an elementary level of math. As a result, anything higher is kept at arms length and feared. Society reinforces these ideas all the time. It is no mystery why the West has a math problem. 

The same cannot be said for those in Eastern countries. They are told that math is hard, but that if they work at it they will succeed. They are shown examples of people who need high level math every day, unlike in the US. 

Math is not hard. It has a PR problem. This is exemplified by the fact that all modern techniques for teaching math require the teacher to ‚Äòtrick‚Äô the student into learning it.

As mentioned in the video the whole school curriculum was a relic of the early years of the 20th century - very inflexible and with heavy emphasis on rote learning. The style of teaching was such that either that one understood the subject matter or not, with no middle ground, because our masters were barely able to explain the core principles well, if at all. I struggled with it constantly, never understood calculus or statistics and eventually managed to pass AO level maths because I wasn't good enough to take it at A level.

People do not feel scared on reading a news article but somehow scared of doing math. In this sense, as a language, math is even simpler than English. There is only one general way to improve people's math skill: immerse yourself into the realm. in fact, we all learn English in this way, aren't we? immersion is key to learning any language, including math. The reason we don't feel afraid of (everyday) English is simply that we immerse into it almost 24/7 since we are born. Ever since we were baby, we listen to English and learn the way it works (aka finding patterns). There shouldn't be any difference for math.

One key distinction between English and math is that we learn math in basically a linear way, which makes early immersion even more important. But at least math is not entirely linear, we have ""core"" and ""academic"" math, but I think we can also add logic into the story. Imagine if we teach high school students the pigeonhole principle, everyone in the room would probably laugh at its triviality, but it is commonly a tool you only see in theoretical math in UNIVERSITY.

P2UpenE_oWM,UgxmOeQgDTaeQgPL9KF4AaABAg,"Not everyone can do computation like Newton, Turing, or Bertrand Russell.

But, yes, I do see this mathematical ineptitude in the UK!

I do so many foreigners working in the City of London in finance and banking.

Most of them are called ""Quants"" who usually came from France in the 1980s to work in areas such as financial engineering, financial risk management or derivative trading; followed by others such as the Asians (Singaporeans/Indians/Chinese/Pakistanis/Japanese, etc.) and the Eurasian Nationalities (e.g. Russians) that do numerate degrees and settle down in the UK.

I have some silly questions to take this debate further ahead =>

-Could this be due to technological reasons? Do people in a Cold Climate struggle with numbers?

- Or is it due to something that has anything to do with the English DNA? How the English people have evolved?

- Or has this got to do something with the education policy and the way the subject is taught in the classroom? The classroom size effect is based on the teacher/student ratio, etc.

- Or is it that some Confucian societies teach students to calculate manually using the Abacus Computation Device? Modern research shows that using the Abacus System can help develop certain parts of the brain which helps students to elevate their numeracy level in applied physical sciences, and so on, etc.

- Lastly, it is how Maths is perceived. Should Maths be taught as a language (an art) or as a science? I think this distinction should be made upfront because the entire system of pedagogy changes once we classify or taxonomize a discipline.

Of course, with the advent of computing technologies, software, coding and programming languages, people tend to rely more on machines and systems, to arrive at numerical solutions to problem solving.

Anyways, this is a big debate, and the British achievements in mathematics and other physical sciences cannot be berated, but, spreading data literacy, increasing numeracy and improving computational capabilities, need an integrated approach and a new education policy.

There should be much more programming education as well.
The goal should be that at least 10% of people can have the potential to get a 6 figure job later.
Most people who were always caught up in maths would go to financial jobs like at deloitte or some bank. But those kinds of jobs you're going through maths education where you.. make proofs, learn to solve novel mathematical problems with novel kinds of mathematical tricks... 

The maths they are talking about .. are about using maths to manage your daily life. I think then just pre-chew it, make an excel sheet with them to calculate a shopping trip. Make excel sheets with students that calculates revenues and expenses for an irregular income.
Make excel sheets to display graphs, make sheets that optimize the choice of buying an item with shipping costs, and one that has a higher price but no shipping costs, then find out at which point the item with shipping costs becomes cheaper, then calculate the cost per liter.

When it comes to stats, i think probability is something everyone can learn. We need to sanitize formulas and algorythms. Some people just need them as a ""recipe""
Just give them the instructions, and let them do the algorythms WITH the instructions but when teaching... USE the instructions.
Here we're given a formula collection, but in class you NEVER use it. Then when you should be using it in an exam, those formulas look completely different and you end up with thousands of question marks. If a teacher had explained why this formula looks different from the one we learned, then you could actually use that book.

However does your average maths teacher explain this, use real world examples in my case no , we simply have mediocre individuals teaching you  that if 2x=4 what is x, and when your average student in my experience quite innocently asks ""when are we going to use this in real life"" they are simply given a vague answer ""well rocket scientists use it"" or if your average teacher can't muster that up they simply accuse the student of being a trouble maker.

I keep making a fuss about how many teachers, and almost all children at age 11, do not understand the rules about how our numbering system works. To test this, ask an 11 year old child WHY the hundreds column is the hundreds column, and I guarantee that very few can tell you (and very few teachers come to that), but yet this is an application of one of the fundamental rules from which everything flows. Without understanding this rule, teachers tell children that they have to use column values in arithmetic and so make it so much harder - children very early on therefore think that they are no good at maths and get turned off. Dienes apparatus reinforces this nonsense - the best place for that is the bin. Zoltan Dienes has really buggered teaching arithmetic! One of my other bugbears is that teachers tell children that multiplication is ""repeated addition""!
