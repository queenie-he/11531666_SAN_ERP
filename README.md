This repository contains the Python code and supporting materials for an Extended Research Project that adopts a hybrid computational social science approach. The study investigates public sentiment towards the UK government's 2023 proposal to extend compulsory mathematics education to age 18 by analyzing a corpus of YouTube comments.

The project employs a dual-layered analysis using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning models to extract semantic structures and infer affective positioning. This enables a multidimensional analysis of both the content and tone of public engagement, bridging the gap between qualitative insight and quantitative scale.
